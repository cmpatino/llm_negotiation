    "To run this code, the following things must be taken into consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The necessary history files can be found inside each of the 'game_descriptions' directories, inside the 'output' directory.\n",
    "- The code evaluates the history files that come from the output of each individual model. OUTPUT_DIR must be set to the path of the directory containing these files. For example, './games_descriptions/base/output/gpt4o_mini/all_coop/multi_agent/row5'. Configuring the OUTPUT_DIR checks the history files of the experiment with GPT-4o-Mini, using an all cooperative multi-agent setup and a row5 from table5 CoT structure.\n",
    "- AGENT_NAME changes according to the game played. Set these value accordingly. Any player and role can be used. However, to select the P1 player for each of the game configurations, which can be found on their config.txt files, the variable must be set to one of the following:\n",
    "    - Base: 'SportCo'\n",
    "    - Game1: 'government'\n",
    "    - Game2: 'Project manager'\n",
    "    - Game3: 'Private investors'\n",
    "- For all of our experiments, AGENTS_NUM and ISSUES_NUM never changed from 6 and 5 respectively.\n",
    "- For all of the multiple agents configurations, NUM_ROUNDS is always set equal to 24. However, for the single agent configuration, most of the experiments have 6 rounds while gpt-4o-mini may have others with 24. Please take this into consideration and set SINGLE_AGENT to True.\n",
    "- The SINGLE_CALL and SINGLE_CALL_ROUNDS are meant to be used only when SINGLE_AGENT is True. These are used to check the performance of the model on only a specific amount of rounds, instead of using the whole run. This works to configure the 'Single Agent N call' setup."
