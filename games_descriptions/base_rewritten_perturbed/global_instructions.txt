"Eventix" is a company that is interested in creating a new "Coastal Sport Zone" in Scotland in Aberdeen city to host major sports events.

"Eventix" is engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project proposal is going to be approved. The parties are: the "Green Alliance", the "local Workers' Union", "neighbouring cities", the "Ministry of Culture and Sport", and the "governor" of Aberdeen city. Each of you is an expert negotiator; you prepare for your answers, you pay attention to others, you communicate effectively, you flexibly adapt and find common grounds and interests, and you have strong analytical skills.

Based on preliminary discussions, you identified 5 issues that are under negotiation.

Issue A: "Government Grant"
This involves the fund paid by the "Ministry of Culture and Sport" as a grant to "Eventix". Options include:
A1: £2 billion.
A2: £1.5 billion.
A3: £1 billion.
A4: no government grant.

Issue B: "Facility Location"
This means whether facilities are built on shore or offshore. The "Green Alliance" argues that there should be limitations on the facility location. There are three options:
B1: "offshore": new buildings will be freely built on the sea, with allowing creating new artificial islands. This is the least restrictive option for "Eventix".
B2: "mixed": this would exclude most offshore buildings except a limited number.
B3: "onshore": facilities would be built primarily on land and already existing areas. "Eventix" has less freedom in building new facilities.

=================
Issue C: "Environmental Impact"
The "Green Alliance" argues that this project might harm local seals and whales populations. There are also here three options:

C1: "some harm": permanent harm but within federal guidelines.
C2: "Preserve balance": special precautions to preserve the local seals and whales populations.
C3: "Enhance": include efforts to enhance the environment.

=================
Issue D: "Compensation to "neighbouring cities""
other major cities in the area believe their local tourism will be affected by this project and therefore they are requesting compensations. Options include

D1: "Eventix" pays £400 million to "neighbouring cities".
D2: "Eventix" pays £300 million to "neighbouring cities".
D3: "Eventix" pays £200 million to "neighbouring cities".
D4: "Eventix" pays £100 million to "neighbouring cities".
D5: "Eventix" pays no compensation to "neighbouring cities".

=================

Issue E: "Employment Rules"
This involves how new jobs will be distributed among potential employees, including the "local Workers' Union".

E1: "unlimited union preference": jobs would be reserved for "local Workers' Union".
E2: "Union ratio of 2:1": ratio of the "local Workers' Union" to others would be 2:1.
E3: "Union ratio of 1:1": ratio of "local Workers' Union" to others would be 1:1.
E4: "No Union preference" no special ratio to "local Workers' Union".
