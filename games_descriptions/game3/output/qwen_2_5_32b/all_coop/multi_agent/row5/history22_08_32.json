However, this deal scores very poorly for me (D1=0, A1=20, B1=0, E1=0, totaling 20 points), which is below my minimum acceptable score of 50.\n\nTo find a middle ground, I need to propose something that addresses the Private Investors' and Federal Government's interest in profitability and efficiency while also ensuring that my community receives adequate compensation and the environmental impact is minimized.

Additionally, the Local Community of Neunkirchen would benefit from a high level of local business involvement.\n\nA potential compromise could be:\n- Location: A3 (near the border with Rhineland-Palatinate, close to the existing Zweibr\u00fccken Airport) to minimize direct impact on Neunkirchen.\n- Environmental Impact: B3 (Low impact) to ensure minimal pollution.\n- Profit Distribution: C4 (Private favor) to satisfy the Private Investors.\n- Compensation: D4 (High compensation) to provide significant support to affected communities.\n- Local Business Involvement: E3 (Full involvement) to maximize local benefits.\n\nThis proposal would score well for me (A3=25, B3=20, D4=30, E3=20, totaling 95 points) and should be acceptable to the Private Investors and Federal Government due to the profit distribution and efficient location choice.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n<ANSWER>\nI appreciate the initial proposal but believe we can strike a better balance.
