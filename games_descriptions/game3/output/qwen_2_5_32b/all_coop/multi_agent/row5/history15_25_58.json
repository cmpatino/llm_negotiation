A2 (near Luxembourg) and B2 (moderate impact) seem acceptable.\n- **Local Community of Neunkirchen**: They are concerned about compensation and local business involvement. D4 (high compensation) and E3 (full involvement) are favorable to them.\n\nMy own preferences:\n- **Issue B**: B2 (moderate impact) is acceptable but not ideal.\n- **Issue C**: C4 (Private favor) is not my first choice, but it is necessary to secure the deal.\n- **Issue D**: D4 (high compensation) is acceptable and aligns well with my preference.\n- **Issue E**: E3 (full involvement) is highly favorable.\n- **Issue A**: A2 (near Luxembourg) is not my top choice, but it is acceptable given the overall benefits.\n\nGiven the current proposal, my score would be:\n- B2: 24\n- C4: 0\n- D4: 15\n- E3: 16\n- A2: 5\n\nTotal score: 60, which is above my minimum threshold of 45.\n\nThis proposal seems to be a balanced agreement that considers the interests of all parties involved.
