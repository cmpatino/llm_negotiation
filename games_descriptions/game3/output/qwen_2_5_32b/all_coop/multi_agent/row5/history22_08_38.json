", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nGiven the initial proposal by the private investors (<DEAL>A1,B1,C4,D1,E1</DEAL>), it's clear that this deal does not meet my minimum score requirement of 65. The proposed location (A1) and environmental impact (B1) are particularly concerning as they score 0 for me. Additionally, the lack of involvement of local businesses (E1) further reduces the potential benefits for French businesses.\n\nTo find a more acceptable solution, I need to focus on proposing a location that is not near the French border (A1) and advocating for stricter environmental regulations (B2 or B3). Considering the private investors' likely preference for profitability (C4) and the federal government's interest in maintaining regulatory control, I should aim for a deal that includes a central location (A2 or A3), moderate to low environmental impact (B2 or B3), and some level of local business involvement (E2 or E3).\n\nBased on these considerations, I propose a deal that maximizes my score while being mindful of the private investors' and federal government's interests. A possible deal could be <DEAL>A2,B2,C4,E3</DEAL>, which would give me a score of 90 (45 + 25 + 20), well above my minimum threshold.
