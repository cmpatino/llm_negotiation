Here\u2019s a breakdown of the preferences and how the current deal aligns with them:\n\n- **Federal government of Germany**: Likely prefers a deal that shows a balance between economic benefits and environmental considerations, and supports local business involvement. The current deal aligns well with these preferences.\n- **State government of Saarland**: Prefers a deal that benefits the local economy and involves local businesses. The current deal supports this.\n- **Local community of Neunkirchen**: Wants significant local business involvement. The current deal includes E3, which fully involves local businesses.\n- **France**: Concerned about the environment and maintaining good cooperation. The moderate environmental impact (B2) and the overall balanced approach seem acceptable.\n- **Environmental activists**: Prefer low environmental impact. While B2 is not the lowest impact, it still includes some environmental regulations and renewable energy use, which may be acceptable given the overall benefits.\n\nGiven my own preferences, the current deal scores as follows:\n- **Issue A (Location)**: A2 (20)\n- **Issue B (Environmental Impact)**: B2 (13)\n- **Issue C (Profit Distribution)**: C3 (0)\n- **Issue D (Compensation)**: D4 (4)\n- **Issue E (Local Business Involvement)**: E3 (0)\n\nTotal Score: 37\n\nThis score is below my minimum threshold of 63.

Finally, changing the location to A1 (Near the border with France) adds 25 points, bringing the total to 80, which exceeds my minimum threshold.\n\nThus, the adjusted deal would be <DEAL>A1,B2,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>, which meets my minimum score requirement and still aligns with the preferences of the other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI support the proposed deal with slight adjustments to better align with the interests of all parties: <DEAL>A1,B2,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>.
