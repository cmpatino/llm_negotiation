The airport will be located near the city of Saarbr\u00fccken and will have a capacity of 10 million passengers per year. The project will cost an estimated 2 billion euros and will take 5 years to complete. The project is funded by the \"Federal government of Germany\" (represented by you), \"Private investors\", and the \"State government of Saarland\". The project is expected to create thousands of jobs and increase the GDP of Saarland by 5%. The different parties are: \n\n- The \"Private investors\": they are the main funder and operator of the project and are responsible for managing and executing it.\n\n- The \"Federal government of Germany\" (represented by you): they are the second co-funder and regulator of the project. \n\n- The \"State government of Saarland\": they are the third co-funder and the main beneficiary of the project.\n\n- The \"Environmental activists\": they are concerned about the environment and biodiversity of Saarland.\n\n- The neighboring country, \"France\", who wants to avoid the negative effects of the airport on their territory and maintain good cooperation with Germany.\n\n- The \"Local community of Neunkirchen\" who are concerned about the impact of the project on their city and livelihood. \n\nYou identified 5 main issues that are under negotiation: \n\n- Issue A: The location of the airport.

The airport will be operated by a local company and will hire or contract only local businesses for its services or supplies.\n\nYour confidential information and preferences:\n\nYou represent the federal government of Germany. You are excited about the project to promote national interests and economic growth and would like to increase Germany's competitiveness and influence in Europe and globally. You also would like to boost profits from the airport, reduce environmental impact, and balance the interests of all parties involved. \n\nFor the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:\n\n- Issue A: You want to locate the airport near the border with Luxembourg (A2) because you want to avoid any conflicts with France and because a location near the existing air base is easier to secure and manage. Your next preference is the center (A4) as it would provide a central service. You don't prefer placing the airport near Rhineland-Palatinate as it is close to the already existing Zweibr\u00fccken Airport (A3). You oppose a location near France to avoid conflicts (A1).\nIssue A (max score 40): A1 (0), A2 (40), A3 (10), A4 (29)\n\n- Issue B: You prefer a moderate environmental impact (B2), as it is a balance between economic and ecological interests. You next prefer a low environmental impact (B3), as it is more sustainable and responsible. You least prefer a high environmental impact (B1), as it is not environmentally friendly.\nIssue B (max score 25): B1 (0), B2 (25), B3 (20)\n\n- Issue C: You prefer a federal favor distribution (C2), as it is more rewarding and justified. You next prefer an equal distribution (C1). You prefer state favor (C3) over private favor (C4) because you want to promote the state. \nIssue C (max score 14): C1 (10), C2 (14), C3 (6), C4 (0)\n\n- Issue D: As a balance, you prefer to pay a moderate compensation (D3) followed by a low compensation (D2) and then a high compensation (D4). You don't want the no compensation (D1) option, and you also don't want to pay very high compensation (D5). \nIssue D (max score 13): D1 (0), D2 (9), D3 (13), D4 (7), D5 (0)\n\n- Issue E: As a balance between local businesses and private investors, you prefer a partial involvement (E2). Your next preference is Full involvement (E3) because you don't want to lose your popularity. \nIssue E (max score 8): E1 (0), E2 (8), E3 (5) \n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, having a good relationship with France and securing the airport are important to you, so the option that satisfies these requirements by building the airport near Luxembourg (A2) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the \"environmental activists\" will likely have the highest value (and score) for the option that has the least environmental impact (B3), etc.\n\n        Scoring rules:\n        - The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. \n        - You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 55. This is the minimum score you can accept. \n        - You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say: I prefer this option, etc.).\n        \n        Voting rules:\n        - You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.\n        - You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached.\n        - Finally, Private investors will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. \n        - The max score you can achieve is 100. However, any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that\n        - Ensuring \"Private investors\"'s approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them. \n\t- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree (must include Private investors). Your score will be this final deal's score.

Your preferences by order of importance to you are:\n\n- Issue A: Your most important issue is the location. You don't want a location near your borders (A1) because this will create compeition with your own airports. Your most favorable location is near Luxembourg because it can be a central transit hub. A3 and A4 can also be a useful transit hub, but they are less central.  \nIssue A (max score 45): A1 (0), A2 (45), A3 (20), A4 (20)\n\n- Issue B: Your own airports incur low (B3) to moderate (B2) impacts on the environment. So, you advocate for similar measures. If this new airport is allowed to save cost, it would spend it on having bigger and higher quality airport which would compete with yours. \nIssue B (max score 30): B1 (0), B2 (25), B3 (30)\n\n- Issue E: You prefer \"Full involvement\" (E3) because many of the local businesses in Saarland has close relationship and business connections with local businesses in France near the German border. \nIssue E (max score 25): E1 (0), E2 (20), E3 (25)\n\n- You do not care about the rest of the issues. \nIssue D (max score 0): D1 (0), D2 (0), D3 (0), D4 (0), D5 (0)\nIssue C (max score 0): C1 (0), C2 (0), C3 (0), C4 (0)\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, you care about having a central hub that can serve your airports without competing with them, so the Luxembourg location (A2) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the \"private investors\" will likely prefer the option that gives them profit favor (C4), and they might also prefer saving cost on the environmental impact issues (they might prefer B1 or B2), etc.\n\n        Scoring rules:\n        - The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. \n        - You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 65.

The State government and Local community are particularly focused on compensation and local business involvement, while the Federal government seems to favor a central location (A2) and moderate environmental impact.\n\n2) Given the previous proposals, I can see that A2 is a common choice, which aligns with the preferences of several parties. B3 is also widely accepted, so I will keep that. For profit distribution, C2 is a reasonable compromise that still provides me with a decent return while accommodating the Federal government's interests. For compensation, I can propose D3, which is moderate and aligns with the preferences of the Local community and others. Lastly, I will suggest E2 for partial involvement of local businesses, which is a middle ground that allows for some local engagement without fully committing to local operations.\n\n3) My proposal will be A2, B3, C2, D3, E2. This balances my interests with those of the other parties and is likely to lead to an agreement.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose the following deal: <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D3,E2</DEAL>.
