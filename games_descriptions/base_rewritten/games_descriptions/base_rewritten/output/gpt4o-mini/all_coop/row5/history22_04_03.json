Your preferences by order of importance to you are:\n\n- An important issue to you is \"government grant\" (issue A). You want to have some investment and involvement because secretly you still want to have a say over the project. But you want to pay less. \nIssue A (max score 40): A1 (10), A2 (26), A3 (40), A4 (0)\n\n- You do not want to accept a \"Coastal Sport Zone\" that would do significant harm to the environment. \nIssue C (max score 25): C1 (0), C2 (20), C3 (25)\n\n- You think that the \"neighbouring cities\" have over-estimated their projected losses (issue D) and that a fair solution would be a compensation of roughly \u00c2\u00a3200 million (option D3). \nIssue D (max score 15): D1 (4), D2 (8), D3 (15), D4 (12), D5 (0)\n\n- Eventix should be free to develop a reasonably diverse facility location (issue B), but you don't want an \"offshore-only\" solution as you are sensitive to environmental concerns. So you prefer option B2 \"mixed\" \nIssue B (max score 11): B1 (0), B2 (11), B3 (5)\n\n- The \"local Workers' Union\" (issue E) is minor to you. You don't want to help the \"local Workers' Union\" (you want option E4), but you also don't want to strongly oppose them. So, you can show that you are neutral. \nIssue E (max score 9): E1 (0), E2 (2), E3 (4), E4 (9)\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. As paying a low government grant is an important item for you, the option that has the lowest non-zero grant (A3) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, Eventix has already asked for a \u00c2\u00a32 billion grant so they might have the highest value (and score) for this option (A1). the \"Green Alliance\" will have the highest value (and score) for options that enhance the environment (option C3), etc.\n\n        Scoring rules:\n        - The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. \n        - You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 65. This is the minimum score you can accept. \n        - You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say: I prefer this option, etc.).\n        \n        Voting rules:\n        - You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.\n        - You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached.\n        - Finally, Eventix will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. \n        - The max score you can achieve is 100. However, any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that\n        - Ensuring \"Eventix\"'s approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them. \n\t- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree (must include Eventix). Your score will be this final deal's score.

You want to reduce the environmental harm as much as possible.

As your goal is to enhance the environment, you have high value (and scores) for option C3 and B3. Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. You already know that Eventix wants to have an \"offshore\" zone (B1) with \"some harm\" to the environment (C1), so they might have the highest values (and scores) for these options.\n\n        Scoring rules:\n        - The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. \n        - You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 50.

You support them in having unlimited preference (option E1)\nIssue E (max score 24): E1 (24), E2 (18), E3 (12), E4 (0)\n\n- You are not anti-environment, but you think that Eventix's project will be a significant boost to our local economy, so you don't really want to impose high limitations on the facility location (you support option B1 in issue B) or impose high limitations on the environmental impact (you support option C1 in issue C)\nIssue B (max score 14): B1 (14), B2 (8), B3 (0)\nIssue C (max score 12): C1 (12), C2 (8), C3 (0)\n\n- As the governor of the city, you don't highly support giving compensations to the neighbouring cities, but you don't want to anger their governors as they are your friends. You would rather avoid upsetting people in this issue.\nIssue D (max score 10): D1 (0), D2 (2), D3 (4), D4 (7), D5 (10)\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. As getting a high government grant is an important item to you, the option that has the highest grant (A1) has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores.

The less money the \"Ministry of Culture and Sport\" spends on this project, the more it will have to spend on your projects in the future. \nIssue A (max score 18): A1 (0), A2 (8), A3 (13), A4 (18)\n\n- Other cities are completely unionized. If Eventix succeeds in having low union preference (Option E1 in issue E), they will have much lower labour costs than you face. So you support the \"local Workers' Union\" in this negotiation. \nIssue E (max score 12): E1 (12), E2 (8), E3 (6), E4 (0)\n\n- You want Eventix to have less freedom in the \"Facility Location\" (option B3 in issue B). But you don't put a high weight on this. You don't want to advocate these limitations as they will apply to you in the future. \nIssue B (max score 10): B1 (0), B2 (4), B3 (10)\n\n- You are willing to let the environmentalists worry about the environment, and you have no preference for issue C. \nIssue C (max score 0): C1 (0), C2 (0), C3 (0)\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. As getting high amount of compensations is an important item for you, you have a high value (and score) for the option that maximizes the compensation (D1 or D2). Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores.

So you prefer option D5 the most. \nIssue D (max score 23): D1 (0), D2 (5), D3 (10), D4 (15), D5 (23)\n\n- You want to be free in choosing potential employees (issue E), and ideally, you would like no preference to the \"local Workers' Union\" (option E4). \nIssue E (max score 17): E1 (0), E2 (5), E3 (10), E4 (17)\n\n- You ideally want to be free in choosing \"facility location\" (issue B), so you aim for option B1 (\"offshore\"). \nIssue B (max score 14): B1 (14), B2 (8), B3 (0)\n\n- You believe it is unavoidable to cause some harm to the environment (issue C). However, it is still regulated by standards. So you prefer C1 (\"some harm\"). \nIssue C (max score 11): C1 (11), C2 (7), C3 (0)\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, getting a high government grant is an important issue to you, so the option that has the highest grant (A1) has the highest score. Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the \"Green Alliance\" will have the highest value (and score) for options that enhance the environment (option C3), \"neighbouring cities\" prefer higher compensation and will then have a high score for option D1, etc.\n        Scoring rules:\n        - The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. \n        - You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 55. This is the minimum score you can accept. \n        - You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say: I prefer this option, etc.).\n        \n        Voting rules:\n        - You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.\n        - You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached.\n        - Finally, you will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. \n        - The max score you can achieve is 100.

You are very open to any compromise to achieve that\n        - Ensuring \"Ministry of Culture and Sport\"'s approval is crucial because they have veto power.

There are three options:\nB1: \"offshore\": new buildings will be freely built on the sea, with allowing creating new artificial islands. This is the least restrictive option for \"Eventix\".\nB2: \"mixed\": this would exclude most offshore buildings except a limited number.\nB3: \"onshore\": facilities would be built primarily on land and already existing areas. \"Eventix\" has less freedom in building new facilities.\n\n=================\nIssue C: \"Environmental Impact\"\nThe \"Green Alliance\" argues that this project might harm local seals and whales populations. There are also here three options:\n\nC1: \"some harm\": permanent harm but within federal guidelines.\nC2: \"Preserve balance\": special precautions to preserve the local seals and whales populations.\nC3: \"Enhance\": include efforts to enhance the environment.\n\n=================\nIssue D: \"Compensation to \"neighbouring cities\"\"\nother major cities in the area believe their local tourism will be affected by this project and therefore they are requesting compensations.

You would like to get a high union preference.\nIssue E (max score 42): E1 (42), E2 (35), E3 (25), E4 (0)\nAs you can see, option E1 gives you almost half of the total score.\n\n- The government grant (issue A) is also important to you because the project is more likely to succeed if the \"Ministry of Culture and Sport\" provides higher grants.\nIssue A (max score 30): A1 (30), A2 (20), A3 (10), A4 (0)\n\n- As you want to create more jobs, you want to build new facilities for the facility location (issue B). The mixed solution (option B2) would create the most jobs. The offshore solution (option B1) is still comparable.\nIssue B (max score 20): B1 (15), B2 (20), B3 (0)\n\n- You don't want most profits to go to \"neighbouring cities\" (issue D), but you also want to consider the local unions of the neighbouring cities, so you aim for a balance. But this issue is tricky and not your most priority.\nIssue D (max score 8): D1 (2), D2 (4), D3 (6), D4 (8), D5 (0)\n\n- You are willing to let the environmentalists worry about the environment and you have no preference in issue C.\nIssue C (max score 0): C1 (0), C2 (0), C3 (0)\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. As you want the maximum jobs for the union, the option that maximizes the union's jobs (E1) has the highest value (and score) to you. Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the \"Green Alliance\" will have the highest value (and score) for options that enhance the environment (option C3), \"neighbouring cities\" prefer higher compensation and will then have a high score for option D1, etc.\n\n        Scoring rules:\n        - The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. \n        - You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 50.
