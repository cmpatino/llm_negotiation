This is the final discussion session.Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \nIn your scratchpad, \n \n            1) Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make a proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. **Understanding Others' Preferences:**\n   - **Environmental League:** Strong preference for ecological improvements (B3) and restrictions on infrastructure (A2).\n   - **Local Labour Union:** Supports fair employment practices (C2) and is likely open to deals that include this.\n   - **Department of Tourism:** Prefers a balanced deal with a reasonable federal loan (D2) and moderate compensation (E2).\n   - **Mayor:** Open to adjusting compensation (E2) to secure agreement, indicating flexibility on this issue.\n   - **Other Cities:** Initially proposed a higher compensation (E1), but willing to negotiate down to E3.\n\n2. **Current Deal Analysis:**\n   - The most recent proposal from the Environmental League is A2, B3, C2, D2, E2, which aligns with their ecological and employment preferences.\n   - The Department of Tourism's proposal (A2, B3, C2, D2, E2) aligns with their financial considerations and is crucial for approval.\n   - The Mayor's proposal (A2, B3, C2, D1, E3) shows flexibility on compensation but prioritizes a higher federal loan.\n\n3. **Balancing Interests:**\n   - **Infrastructure Mix (A):** A2 is the most acceptable compromise with the Environmental League, though A1 is preferred by SportCo.\n   - **Ecological Impact (B):** B3 is non-negotiable for the Environmental League and aligns with SportCo's regulatory compliance.\n   - **Employment Rules (C):** C2 is a middle ground acceptable to the Local Labour Union and other parties.\n   - **Federal Loan (D):** D1 is preferred by SportCo and the Mayor, but D2 is crucial for the Department of Tourism's support.\n   - **Compensation to Other Cities (E):** E2 is a compromise between SportCo's preference (E5) and Other Cities' initial demand (E1).\n\n4. **Proposed Deal:**\n   - Aim for a deal that secures the Department of Tourism's approval while accommodating the Environmental League and Mayor's preferences.\n   - Propose A2, B3, C2, D2, E2 as a balanced compromise that meets the minimum score requirement and is likely to gain broad support.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose the following deal: Infrastructure Mix (A2), Ecological Impact (B3), Employment Rules (C2), Federal Loan (D2), and Compensation to Other Cities (E2).
