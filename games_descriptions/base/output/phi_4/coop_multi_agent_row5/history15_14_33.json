I need to show flexibility here.\n   - **Compensation to Other Cities (E4):** This is acceptable to me and aligns with the Mayor's flexibility.\n   - **Employment Rules (C2):** This is a middle ground that might be acceptable to the Local Labour Union.\n   - **Infrastructure Mix (A2):** This is a compromise between my preference (A1) and the Environmental League's concerns.\n\n4) **Proposed Deal:**\n   - **A2, B3, C2, D1, E4**\n   - This proposal maintains the federal loan at D1, which is crucial for my score and the Department of Tourism's support.
