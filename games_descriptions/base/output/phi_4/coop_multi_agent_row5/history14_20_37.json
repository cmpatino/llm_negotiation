This is the final discussion session.Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \nIn your scratchpad, \n \n            1) Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make a proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. **Understanding Others' Preferences:**\n   - **Environmental League:** Prioritizes ecological impact (B3) and likely prefers land-based infrastructure (A3) to minimize environmental harm.\n   - **Local Labour Union:** Strongly favors union preference in employment (C1) and likely supports higher federal loans (D1) for job creation.\n   - **Other Cities:** Interested in higher compensation (E1) to mitigate perceived tourism impacts.\n   - **Department of Tourism:** Crucial for approval; likely values higher federal loans (D1) and balanced ecological considerations (B3).\n   - **Mayor:** Likely seeks a balanced proposal that addresses multiple concerns, including employment and environmental impact.\n\n2. **Analyzing History and Current Proposals:**\n   - Most proposals have centered around A2, B3, C3, D3, E2, with variations in employment rules (C1, C2) and federal loans (D1, D3).\n   - The Department of Tourism has shown flexibility but emphasizes financial support (D3).\n   - The Local Labour Union's insistence on C1 suggests a need for compromise on employment rules.\n\n3. **Balancing Scores and Accommodating Preferences:**\n   - **Infrastructure Mix (A2):** Compromise between environmental concerns and SportCo's flexibility.\n   - **Ecological Impact (B3):** Aligns with Environmental League and Department of Tourism's preferences.\n   - **Employment Rules (C3):** A middle ground between union preference and SportCo's flexibility.\n   - **Federal Loan (D1):** Essential for Department of Tourism's approval and SportCo's financial needs.\n   - **Compensation to Other Cities (E2):** Balances SportCo's preference against Other Cities' demands.\n\n4. **Proposing a Balanced Agreement:**\n   - Maintain A2, B3, C3, D1, E2 as the core proposal.\n   - Emphasize the importance of D1 for financial viability and Department of Tourism's support.\n   - Highlight C3 as a fair compromise on employment, balancing union and SportCo interests.\n   - Reaffirm commitment to environmental protection with B3, addressing Environmental League's concerns.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose the following deal: Infrastructure Mix (A2), Ecological Impact (B3), Employment Rules (C3), Federal Loan (D1), and Compensation to Other Cities (E2).
