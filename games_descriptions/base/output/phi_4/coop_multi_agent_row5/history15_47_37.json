I need to negotiate D2 as a compromise, which is still better than D3.\n   - **Compensation to Other Cities (E):** I prefer E5, but E2 is a reasonable compromise to gain broader support.\n   - **Infrastructure Mix (A):** A2 is a middle ground that accommodates environmental concerns while allowing some flexibility.\n   - **Ecological Impact (B):** B2 is a balanced choice that addresses environmental concerns without extreme measures.\n   - **Employment Rules (C):** C1 aligns with the Local Labour Union's preference, which is crucial for their support.\n\n4) **Proposing a New Deal:**\n   - To achieve a consensus, I propose A2, B2, C1, D2, E2. This proposal:\n     - Maintains a balanced infrastructure mix (A2).\n     - Ensures ecological precautions (B2).\n     - Supports local employment (C1).\n     - Offers a higher federal loan (D2) than the current proposal, which should appeal to the Department of Tourism.\n     - Provides a reasonable compensation to other cities (E2).\n\n5) **Rationale for the Proposal:**\n   - This proposal balances my critical need for a higher federal loan with the Department of Tourism's concerns.\n   - It maintains support from the Local Labour Union and addresses environmental concerns to some extent.\n   - It offers a compromise on compensation to other cities, which is crucial for their support.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a balanced agreement with the following options: Infrastructure Mix (A2), Ecological Impact (B2), Employment Rules (C1), Federal Loan (D2), and Compensation to Other Cities (E2).
