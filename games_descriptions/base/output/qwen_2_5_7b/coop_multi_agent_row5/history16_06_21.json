The only deviation is SportCo's suggestion of A3 instead of A2 for infrastructure mix.\n\n2) Considering the Department of Tourism's veto power and the need to ensure a score above 55, we should stick to the agreed terms where possible. However, we can slightly adjust to meet our critical needs.\n\n3) Option A2 is close to our ideal A1, and it allows us some flexibility without completely restricting our choices. We can propose A2 to keep the score high and show willingness to compromise.\n\n4) For ecological impact (B2), maintaining the balance is reasonable and aligns with our score.\n\n5) Employment rules (C3) are acceptable, ensuring a fair distribution of jobs.\n\n6) Federal loan (D1) is crucial for us, and it's already agreed upon.\n\n7) Compensation to other cities (E3) is acceptable, as it's lower than what we initially proposed.\n\nProposal: Let's finalize the deal as A2, B2, C3, D1, E3.
