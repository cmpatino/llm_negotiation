Other cities proposed A2, B2, C1, D2, E3, giving a score of 83. The Local Labour Union proposed the same as Other cities, A2, B2, C1, D2, E3, also giving a score of 83. The Environmental League proposed A2, B2, C4, D1, E2, giving a score of 85.\n\n2) The Mayor's proposal includes the highest federal loan (D1), but SportCo prefers D2. The Department of Tourism is flexible on the federal loan to D2, which is a good sign. The Local Labour Union and Other cities both prefer C1, which aligns with SportCo's preference for no union preference (C4).\n\n3) The Environmental League and Department of Tourism are both flexible on the ecological impact (B2). The Mayor's proposal includes some damage (B2), which is acceptable to SportCo.\n\n4) The compensation to Other cities (E3) is acceptable to SportCo, and the Department of Tourism seems to be flexible on this point.\n\n5) The Mayor's proposal includes the highest federal loan, which is crucial for SportCo. The Department of Tourism's proposal includes a lower federal loan, which is more acceptable to SportCo.\n\nGiven these points, a balanced agreement could be A2, B2, C1, D2, E3, which gives a score of 83.
