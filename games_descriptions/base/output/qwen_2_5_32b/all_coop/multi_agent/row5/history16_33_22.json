The Department of Tourism, however, might be more flexible on the funding aspect, especially if it can secure a deal that includes some form of environmental protection and labor union support, which could be beneficial for their public image.\n\nConsidering the Environmental League's concern for ecological impact and the Local Labour Union's interest in employment rules, I can propose a deal that slightly restricts infrastructure mix and provides some level of union preference, while also securing a moderate federal loan and significant compensation for other cities.\n\nA possible deal could be: A2,B2,C2,D2,E2.
