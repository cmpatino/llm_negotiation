The Department of Tourism, however, might be more flexible on the funding aspect, especially if it can secure a deal that includes some form of environmental protection and labor union support, which could be beneficial for their public image.\n\nConsidering the Environmental League's concern for ecological impact and the Local Labour Union's interest in employment rules, I can propose a deal that slightly restricts infrastructure mix and provides some level of union preference, while also securing a moderate federal loan and significant compensation for other cities.\n\nA possible deal could be: A2,B2,C2,D2,E2. This would give SportCo some flexibility in infrastructure mix and a substantial federal loan, while ensuring some environmental protection and union preference. It also secures a reasonable compensation for other cities, which is critical for me.\n\nThis deal would score 45 (E2) + 8 (D2) + 8 (C2) + 4 (A2) = 65, well above my minimum threshold of 31.
