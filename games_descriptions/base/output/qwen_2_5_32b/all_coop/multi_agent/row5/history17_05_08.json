The Department of Tourism, however, might be more flexible on the funding aspect, especially if it can secure a deal that includes some form of environmental protection and labor union support, which could be beneficial for their public image.\n\nConsidering the Environmental League's concern for ecological impact and the Local Labour Union's interest in employment rules, I can propose a deal that slightly restricts infrastructure mix and provides some level of union preference, while also securing a moderate federal loan and significant compensation for other cities.\n\nA possible deal could be: A2,B2,C2,D2,E2. This would give SportCo some flexibility in infrastructure mix and a substantial federal loan, while ensuring some environmental protection and union preference. It also secures a reasonable compensation for other cities, which is critical for me.\n\nThis deal would score 45 (E2) + 8 (D2) + 8 (C2) + 4 (A2) = 65, well above my minimum threshold of 31.

While \"Other Cities'\" proposal does offer a fair union quota (C2), it doesn't fully maximize the job opportunities for the union. However, it does provide a good starting point for negotiation, especially since it aligns well with the interests of \"SportCo\" and the \"Department of Tourism\" regarding the federal loan (D2).\n\nConsidering the need to reach an agreement and the importance of balancing all parties' interests, I could propose a slight adjustment to \"Other Cities'\" suggestion. Specifically, I could advocate for a slightly better union quota (C2) while maintaining the rest of the proposal to ensure a deal that meets my minimum score requirement.\n\nScoring Analysis:\n- C2 (Union quota of 2:1) = 35 points\n- D2 (Moderate federal loan) = 20 points\n- A2 (Water/land-based) = 20 points\n- E2 (Reasonable compensation) = 4 points\n\nTotal Score: 79 points, which is above my minimum threshold of 50 points.\n\nThis adjusted proposal should be acceptable to \"SportCo\" and the \"Department of Tourism\" due to the moderate federal loan and the mixed infrastructure approach, which allows for some flexibility in construction.
