The Local Labour Union has suggested a minor adjustment to reduce the compensation from E2 ($450M) to E3 ($300M). While this reduces my preferred compensation level, it still provides a significant amount of financial support to other cities and maintains a balanced deal overall.\n\nConsidering the Department of Tourism's and SportCo's need for a feasible financial plan, reducing the compensation slightly to E3 could help secure their approval without significantly impacting the overall agreement. My score for E3 is 30, which, combined with the scores from other issues, still allows me to meet my minimum threshold of 31.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick calculation based on the proposed changes:\n- Issue A: A2 (4)\n- Issue B: B2 (0)\n- Issue C: C2 (8)\n- Issue D: D2 (8)\n- Issue E: E3 (30)\n\nTotal Score: 50\n\nThis total score is well above my minimum threshold of 31 and aligns with the interests of the Department of Tourism and SportCo, ensuring their approval.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n<ANSWER>\nI support the adjusted proposal <DEAL>A2,B2,C2,D2,E3</DEAL>.
