The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\n1) **Others' Preferences:**\n   - **Environmental League:** Likely prefers A3, B3, C4, D4, E5.\n   - **Local Labour Union:** Likely prefers C1 or C2.\n   - **Other Cities:** Likely prefers E1 or E2.\n   - **Department of Tourism:** Likely prefers a balanced approach but leans towards higher federal loans.\n   - **Mayor:** Likely prefers a balanced approach.\n\n2) **Proposals:**\n   - **Proposal 1:** <DEAL>A2,B2,C3,D2,E2</DEAL>\n     - Score: 8 + 7 + 10 + 29 + 5 = 69\n   - **Proposal 2:** <DEAL>A3,B2,C3,D2,E3</DEAL>\n     - Score: 0 + 7 + 10 + 29 + 10 = 56\n   - **Proposal 3:** <DEAL>A2,B2,C3,D3,E4</DEAL>\n     - Score: 8 + 7 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 60\n\n3) **Final Deal Selection:**\n   - **Selected Final Deal:** <DEAL>A2,B2,C3,D2,E2</DEAL>\n     - Score: 69\n     - Reason: Balances interests well, meets my minimum score requirement, and aligns with the majority's preferences.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI suggest we finalize the deal as <DEAL>A2,B2,C3,D2,E2</DEAL>.
