This proposal balances the needs of all parties, addresses environmental concerns, ensures financial stability, and minimizes compensation to other cities.\n \n . Other cities: \nI propose we consider <DEAL>A2,B2,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>. This proposal balances the needs of all parties, addresses environmental concerns, ensures fair employment rules, and provides a reasonable federal loan amount along with fair compensation to other cities.\n </HISTORY> \nThe following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n- Suggest A1 to maximize infrastructure freedom.\n- Push for B1, emphasizing regulatory compliance.\n- Insist on C4 for operational flexibility.\n- Compromise on D3 to secure a significant federal loan.\n- Offer E4 as a fair compensation to other cities.\n </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session.\n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n \n            Make three different proposals that maximize your scores based on these conditions.\n            From these three proposals, select the one final deal that accomplish your goal.\n Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, write down your observations, show intermediate calculations of deals and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nObservations:\n- The Local Labour Union prefers C2 and E4.\n- The Department of Tourism prefers D3 and E3.\n- The Environmental League prefers B3 and E4.\n- The Mayor prefers D3 and E4.\n- Other Cities prefer E3.\n\nPrevious Plan:\n- Suggest A1 to maximize infrastructure freedom.\n- Push for B1, emphasizing regulatory compliance.\n- Insist on C4 for operational flexibility.\n- Compromise on D3 to secure a significant federal loan.\n- Offer E4 as a fair compensation to other cities.\n\nCalculations:\n1.
