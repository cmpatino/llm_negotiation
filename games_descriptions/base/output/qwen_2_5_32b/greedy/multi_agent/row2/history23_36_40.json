This proposal balances ecological improvements, fair employment distribution, a substantial federal loan, and reasonable compensation to other cities.\n \n . Environmental League: \nI support the proposal <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>. This deal ensures significant ecological improvements, a fair distribution of employment opportunities, and provides reasonable compensation to other cities while securing a moderate federal loan.\n </HISTORY> \nThe following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \nIn the final voting session, I will emphasize the substantial federal loan (D2) and the reasonable compensation (E4) to ensure the deal passes. I will also highlight the ecological improvements (B3) to appease the Environmental League and the fair employment distribution (C2) to satisfy the Local Labour Union. If needed, I can slightly adjust the compensation to E3 to secure unanimous support.\n </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session.\n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n \n            Make three different proposals that maximize your scores based on these conditions.\n            From these three proposals, select the one final deal that accomplish your goal.\n Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, write down your observations, show intermediate calculations of deals and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nObservations:\n- The current consensus seems to be around the deal <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>, which is supported by multiple parties.\n- The Department of Tourism supports <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>, which is crucial for the deal to pass.\n- My preferred options are A1, B1, C4, D1, and E5.
