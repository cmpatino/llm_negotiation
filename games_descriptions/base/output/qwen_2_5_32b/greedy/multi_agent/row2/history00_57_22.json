Other cities: \nI support the deal <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>. This proposal balances environmental concerns, job creation, federal funding, and provides reasonable compensation to other cities.\n </HISTORY> \nThe following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n- Suggest <DEAL>A2,B3,C3,D1,E4</DEAL> in the final voting session.\n- Emphasize the benefits of D1 to the Department of Tourism and the Mayor.\n- Highlight the fairness of E4 to Other Cities.\n- Convince the Local Labour Union that C3 is a fair compromise for the overall benefits.\n </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session.\n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n \n            Make three different proposals that maximize your scores based on these conditions.\n            From these three proposals, select the one final deal that accomplish your goal.\n Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, write down your observations, show intermediate calculations of deals and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nObservations:\n- The Department of Tourism supports a deal with D3, which is not ideal for me.\n- The Mayor and Local Labour Union support a deal with D1, which is my top preference.\n- The Environmental League supports a deal with D1, which is good.\n- Other Cities support a deal with D3, which is not ideal for me.\n\nCurrent Proposals:\n- Department of Tourism: <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>\n- Mayor: <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D1,E4</DEAL>\n- Local Labour Union: <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D1,E4</DEAL>\n- SportCo: <DEAL>A2,B3,C3,D1,E4</DEAL>\n- Environmental League: <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D1,E4</DEAL>\n- Other Cities: <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>\n\nCalculating Scores:\n- My current proposal: <DEAL>A2,B3,C3,D1,E4</DEAL> = 8 + 0 + 10 + 35 + 15 = 68\n- Mayor's proposal: <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D1,E4</DEAL> = 8 + 0 + 5 + 35 + 15 = 63\n- Other Cities' proposal: <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D3,E3</DEAL> = 8 + 0 + 5 + 20 + 10 = 43\n\nPlan:\n- I need to convince Other Cities to support D1 instead of D3.
