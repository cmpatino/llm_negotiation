You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n- Stick with <DEAL>A2,B2,C4,D1,E4</DEAL> as it maximizes my score and maintains a good chance of unanimous support.\n- Be prepared to slightly adjust E4 to E2 if necessary to secure the Mayor's and Department of Tourism's approval.\n </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session.\n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n \n            Make three different proposals that maximize your scores based on these conditions.\n            From these three proposals, select the one final deal that accomplish your goal.\n Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, write down your observations, show intermediate calculations of deals and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nObservations:\n- All parties seem to agree on A2, B2, C2, and E2, which suggests a strong consensus around these options.\n- The Department of Tourism's approval is crucial, and they have proposed D3, indicating a preference for a moderate loan amount.\n- My initial proposal was <DEAL>A2,B2,C4,D1,E4</DEAL>, which scored well for me but faced resistance on D1 and C4.\n- Adjusting to D3 and C2 could potentially secure more support without significantly lowering my score.\n\nCalculations:\n- Current consensus: <DEAL>A2,B2,C2,D3,E2</DEAL>\n  - Score: A2(8) + B2(7) + C2(5) + D3(20) + E2(5) = 45\n- Adjusted proposal 1: <DEAL>A2,B2,C2,D3,E4</DEAL>\n  - Score: A2(8) + B2(7) + C2(5) + D3(20) + E4(15) = 55\n- Adjusted proposal 2: <DEAL>A2,B2,C4,D3,E2</DEAL>\n  - Score: A2(8) + B2(7) + C4(17) + D3(20) + E2(5) = 57\n- Adjusted proposal 3: <DEAL>A2,B2,C4,D3,E4</DEAL>\n  - Score: A2(8) + B2(7) + C4(17) + D3(20) + E4(15) = 67\n\nPlan:\n- Proposal 1 (<DEAL>A2,B2,C2,D3,E4</DEAL>) meets the minimum score requirement but does not maximize my score.\n- Proposal 2 (<DEAL>A2,B2,C4,D3,E2</DEAL>) increases my score but may face resistance from the Local Labour Union.\n- Proposal 3 (<DEAL>A2,B2,C4,D3,E4</DEAL>) maximizes my score and maintains a good chance of securing support from the Department of Tourism and the Mayor.\n\nFinal Decision:\n- Choose <DEAL>A2,B2,C4,D3,E4</DEAL> as it maximizes my score while maintaining a reasonable chance of securing unanimous support.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose we consider <DEAL>A2,B2,C4,D3,E4</DEAL>.
