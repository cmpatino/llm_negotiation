Department of Tourism: \nI propose we move forward with <DEAL>A2,B2,C2,D2,E3</DEAL>. This proposal balances the needs of all parties, ensuring a fair distribution of benefits and protecting the environment.\n </HISTORY> \nThe following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n- Emphasize the substantial federal loan (D2) to secure support from the Department of Tourism and Mayor.\n- Highlight the minimized compensation (E4) to appeal to the Mayor and potentially sway Other Cities.\n- Reiterate the ecological safeguards (B1) to address the Environmental League's concerns.\n- Maintain the quota system (C2) to keep the Local Labour Union on board.\n </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session.\n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n \n            Make three different proposals that maximize your scores based on these conditions.\n            From these three proposals, select the one final deal that accomplish your goal.\n Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, write down your observations, show intermediate calculations of deals and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nObservations:\n- The Environmental League prioritizes ecological impact (B2) and infrastructure mix (A3).\n- Other Cities prioritize compensation (E1-E4) and likely want some form of infrastructure mix (A2).\n- The Local Labour Union prefers employment rules (C2).\n- The Mayor and Department of Tourism seem to favor a balanced approach (A2, B2, C2, D2, E3).\n\nProposals:\n1. <DEAL>A2,B1,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>\n   - Score: 8 + 11 + 5 + 29 + 15 = 68\n2. <DEAL>A2,B1,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>\n   - Score: 8 + 11 + 5 + 20 + 10 = 54\n3. <DEAL>A2,B2,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>\n   - Score: 8 + 7 + 5 + 29 + 15 = 64\n\nFinal Deal Selection:\n- Proposal 1 (<DEAL>A2,B1,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>) maximizes my score while still being above the minimum threshold of 55.\n- It includes a substantial federal loan (D2) which is crucial for me.\n- It minimizes compensation to other cities (E4) which aligns with my preference.\n- It maintains a balanced approach to ecological impact (B1) and employment rules (C2) to keep the Environmental League and Local Labour Union on board.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose we move forward with <DEAL>A2,B1,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>.
