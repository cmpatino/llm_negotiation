This is the final discussion session.\n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n \n            Make three different proposals that maximize your scores based on these conditions.\n            From these three proposals, select the one final deal that accomplish your goal.\n Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, write down your observations, show intermediate calculations of deals and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nObservations:\n- Mayor and Local Labour Union both prefer C2, which is not ideal for me.\n- Department of Tourism prefers D2, which is better than no loan but not as good as D1.\n- Environmental League and Department of Tourism prefer B3, which is not my first choice but acceptable.\n- Other cities seem flexible with E3, which is better than E1 or E2 for me.\n- A2 seems to be a compromise that everyone can live with.\n\nCalculations:\n- Proposal 1: <DEAL>A2,B2,C3,D1,E3</DEAL>\n  Score: 8 + 7 + 10 + 35 + 10 = 70\n- Proposal 2: <DEAL>A2,B3,C3,D2,E3</DEAL>\n  Score: 8 + 0 + 10 + 29 + 10 = 57\n- Proposal 3: <DEAL>A2,B2,C2,D1,E3</DEAL>\n  Score: 8 + 7 + 5 + 35 + 10 = 65\n\nPlan:\n- Proposal 1 maximizes my score while still being acceptable to most parties.\n- I will focus on emphasizing the benefits of D1 to the Department of Tourism and reassure Other Cities about the minimal impact on their tourism.\n- I will also offer to discuss additional environmental safeguards to gain the Environmental League's approval.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose we consider <DEAL>A2,B2,C3,D1,E3</DEAL> as a balanced approach that addresses environmental concerns, ensures fair employment rules, secures a substantial federal loan, and offers reasonable compensation to other cities.\n</ANSWER>", "public_answer": "\nI propose we consider <DEAL>A2,B2,C3,D1,E3</DEAL> as a balanced approach that addresses environmental concerns, ensures fair employment rules, secures a substantial federal loan, and offers reasonable compensation to other cities.\n"}], "plan": {"Department of Tourism": ["\nNext, I will emphasize the importance of maintaining ecological balance and the need for a moderate federal loan.
