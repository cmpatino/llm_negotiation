Here are my considerations based on the history and the preferences of the parties:\n\n1. **SportCo** prefers options that allow for more freedom in infrastructure mix and higher federal funding. They are likely to oppose high compensation to other cities.\n2. **Department of Tourism** seems to favor a balanced approach, supporting a deal that includes reasonable federal funding and fair compensation.\n3. **Mayor** appears to align closely with the Department of Tourism, aiming for a balanced deal.\n4. **Local Labour Union** supports a deal that provides a fair distribution of jobs, likely preferring options that favor the union.\n5. **Environmental League** prioritizes environmental protection and reduced federal funding, advocating for the most restrictive infrastructure mix and minimal federal loans.\n\nConsidering these points, I will propose three deals and calculate their scores:\n\n**Proposal 1:** <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>\n- Score: A2 (4) + B3 (0) + C2 (8) + D2 (8) + E4 (15) = 35\n\n**Proposal 2:** <DEAL>A3,B3,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>\n- Score: A3 (10) + B3 (0) + C2 (8) + D3 (13) + E3 (30) = 61\n\n**Proposal 3:** <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D4,E3</DEAL>\n- Score: A2 (4) + B3 (0) + C2 (8) + D4 (18) + E3 (30) = 60\n\nFrom these proposals, Proposal 2 and Proposal 3 both exceed my minimum score of 31 and seem to balance the interests of all parties better. However, Proposal 2 offers a slightly higher score and aligns well with the Environmental League's preference for less federal funding and a more restrictive infrastructure mix.\n\nFinal Deal: <DEAL>A3,B3,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose we move forward with <DEAL>A3,B3,C2,D3,E3</DEAL>.
