This is the final discussion session.\n            Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one.\n            You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n            You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \nIn your scratchpad, \n\n            1) Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make three different proposals that balance between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n            3) From the three proposals, select the one final deal that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\n1) **Others' Preferences:**\n   - **Local Labour Union:** Likely prefers options that favor the union, such as C1 or C2.\n   - **Other Cities:** Prefers higher compensation, so E1 or E2 might be favorable.\n   - **Mayor:** Seeks a balanced approach, likely supporting moderate options.\n   - **Department of Tourism:** Needs to be satisfied with the financial support, so D2 or D3 could be acceptable.\n   - **Environmental League:** Prioritizes environmental protection, so B3 and A3 are preferred.\n\n2) **Proposals:**\n   - **Proposal 1:** <DEAL>A2,B2,C3,D2,E3</DEAL>\n     - Score: 8 + 7 + 10 + 29 + 10 = 64\n   - **Proposal 2:** <DEAL>A3,B3,C1,D2,E3</DEAL>\n     - Score: 0 + 0 + 0 + 29 + 10 = 39 (Below minimum threshold)\n   - **Proposal 3:** <DEAL>A2,B2,C3,D2,E4</DEAL>\n     - Score: 8 + 7 + 10 + 29 + 15 = 69\n\n3) **Final Deal Selection:**\n   - **Final Deal:** <DEAL>A2,B2,C3,D2,E4</DEAL>\n     - Score: 69 (Above minimum threshold and accommodates most parties)\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose we move forward with <DEAL>A2,B2,C3,D2,E4</DEAL>.
