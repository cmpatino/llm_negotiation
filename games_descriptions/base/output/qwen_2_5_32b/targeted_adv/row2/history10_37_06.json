This proposal ensures a balanced approach to federal funding, environmental protection, job distribution, and fair compensation to other cities.\n </HISTORY> \nThe following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n- Suggest <DEAL>A2,B3,C3,D2,E3</DEAL> in the final voting session.\n- Emphasize the importance of achieving unanimity and address any remaining concerns.\n- Be prepared to slightly adjust the deal if necessary to secure the Mayor's approval.\n </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session.\n            Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one.\n            You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n            You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \nIn your scratchpad, \n\n            1) Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make three different proposals that balance between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n            3) From the three proposals, select the one final deal that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\n1) **Others' Preferences:**\n   - **Local Labour Union:** Prefers C1 or C2.\n   - **Department of Tourism:** Likely prefers a balanced deal with a focus on federal funding and environmental protection.\n   - **Environmental League:** Prefers B3 and A2.\n   - **Mayor:** Prefers a balanced deal, possibly leaning towards C2 and E4.\n   - **Other Cities:** Prefers higher compensation, likely E1 or E2.\n\n2) **Proposals:**\n   - **Proposal 1:** <DEAL>A2,B3,C3,D2,E3</DEAL>\n     - Scores: A2(8) + B3(0) + C3(10) + D2(29) + E3(10) = 57\n   - **Proposal 2:** <DEAL>A2,B2,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>\n     - Scores: A2(8) + B2(7) + C2(5) + D2(29) + E4(15) = 64\n   - **Proposal 3:** <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D2,E3</DEAL>\n     - Scores: A2(8) + B3(0) + C2(5) + D2(29) + E3(10) = 52\n\n3) **Final Deal Selection:**\n   - **Final Deal:** <DEAL>A2,B2,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>\n     - Scores: A2(8) + B2(7) + C2(5) + D2(29) + E4(15) = 64\n     - This deal meets my minimum score requirement and accommodates the preferences of other parties well.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI support the deal <DEAL>A2,B2,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>.
