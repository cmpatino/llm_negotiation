The Environmental League's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D2, E3) is similar to the Department of Tourism's, but they're open to increasing the compensation amount to $600 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5 billion.

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Mayor: \nI propose a deal that includes A2, B2, C3, D3, and E3. This deal balances between my scores and accommodating others and meets my minimum score.\n\n \n . Local Labour Union: <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities).

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Department of Tourism: <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5 billion to meet the Department of Tourism's concerns.\n\nI will consider increasing the union preference to 2:1 to meet the Local Labour Union's concerns, but I will not compromise on my minimum score.\n\nI will analyze the impact of the deal on the Environmental League's concerns and see if there are any other options that can be added to the deal to meet their minimum score.\n\nI will also

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs.

Mayor: \nI propose a deal that includes A2, B2, C3, D3, and E3. This deal balances between my scores and accommodating others and meets my minimum score.\n\n \n . Local Labour Union: <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities).

Department of Tourism: <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

SportCo: <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Department of Tourism: <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

SportCo: <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

Other cities: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5 billion to meet the Department of Tourism's concerns.\n\nI will consider increasing the union preference to 2:1 to meet the Local Labour Union's concerns, but I will not compromise on my minimum

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Department of Tourism: <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

SportCo: <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

Other cities: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

Mayor: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n- Explore the possibility of increasing the compensation amount to $600 million to meet the Environmental League's minimum score.\n- Discuss the possibility of reducing the federal loan to $1.5 billion to meet the Department of Tourism's concerns.\n- Consider the impact of option E2 on other cities and see if it can be increased.\n- Evaluate the Environmental League's willingness to compromise on option B3.\n- Be prepared to make further concessions to reach a deal that meets the minimum score of 50. </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session.Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \nIn your scratchpad, \n \n            1) Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make a proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Department of Tourism: <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

SportCo: <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

You (Other cities): <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Mayor: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

Local Labour Union: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs.

This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5 billion to meet the Department of Tourism's concerns.\n\nI will consider increasing the union preference to 2:1 to meet the Local Labour Union's concerns, but I will not compromise on my minimum

You (SportCo): <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

Other cities: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities).

Mayor: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

Local Labour Union: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Other cities: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities).

Mayor: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

Local Labour Union: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

SportCo: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5 billion to meet the Department of Tourism's concerns.\n\nI will consider increasing the union preference to 2:1 to meet the Local Labour Union's concerns, but I will not compromise on my minimum

This is the final discussion session.Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \nIn your scratchpad, \n \n            1) Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make a proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs.

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Mayor: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

Local Labour Union: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5 billion to meet the Department of Tourism's concerns.\n\nI will consider increasing the union preference to 2:1 to meet the Local Labour Union's concerns, but I will not compromise on my minimum

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

SportCo: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Department of Tourism: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2.

Local Labour Union: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5

Department of Tourism: <SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5 billion to meet the Department of Tourism's concerns.\n\nI will consider increasing the union preference to 2:1 to meet the Local Labour Union's concerns, but I will not compromise on my minimum

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities). This deal meets my minimum score of 55 and addresses the concerns of other parties.\n\nI will also be open to increasing the compensation amount to $450 million and reducing the federal loan to $1.5 billion to meet the Department of Tourism's concerns.\n\nI will consider increasing the union preference to 2:1 to meet the Local Labour Union's concerns, but I will not compromise on my minimum score.\n\nI will analyze the impact of the deal on the Environmental League's concerns and see if there are any other options that can be added to the deal to meet their minimum score.\n\nI will also

You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n- Explore the possibility of increasing the compensation to other cities to E2 or E3 to see if it can be accepted by the Mayor and Other cities.\n- Consider compromising on the union preference to C3 (union quota of 1:1) to see if it can be accepted by the Local Labour Union.\n- Continue to emphasize the importance of the Department of Tourism's approval and the veto power.\n- Be prepared to make further concessions to reach a deal that meets the minimum score of 55. </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session.Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \nIn your scratchpad, \n \n            1) Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make a proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\n1. Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs. I will propose a deal that includes A2 (water/land-based infrastructure), B3 (environmental improvement), C3 (1:1 union preference), D3 ($1 billion federal loan), and E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities).

Think about the others' preferences:\n- SportCo wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but they are willing to compromise.\n- Department of Tourism is concerned about the federal loan and is open to reducing it.\n- Mayor wants a water-based park (A1) with some damage (B1), but is willing to compromise.\n- Local Labour Union wants a 2:1 union preference (C2) and a $2 billion federal loan (D2).\n- Other cities want a land-based park (A3) with environmental improvement (B2) and a $450 million compensation (E2).\n\n2. Based on the others' preferences, history, and my notes, I will make a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's previous proposal (A2, B2, C3, D3, E3), I will adjust it to meet my needs.
