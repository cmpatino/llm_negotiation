feedback and the need to balance the concerns of all parties, we should aim for a deal that minimizes environmental disruption while still providing significant economic benefits.

Let's consider incorporating enhanced ecological restoration measures and adjusting the federal loan structure to better fit \"SportCo's\" needs.\n\n### PLAN\nNext steps could include exploring additional funding sources, refining the ecological restoration plans, and potentially adjusting the federal loan structure to better match \"SportCo's\" budgetary constraints.\n\n### ANSWER\nWe agree on the deal where \"SportCo\" opts for a \"water-based\" park (A1), maintains some level of ecological damage (B2), ensures fair employment opportunities (C2), secures a substantial federal loan (D2), and provides compensation to other cities (E2).\n\nThis approach strikes a good balance between \"SportCo's\" goals and the concerns of various stakeholders. Moving forward, let's continue to refine the plan together to address remaining uncertainties and optimize the overall outcome.\n\n### PLAN\nNext steps could include exploring additional funding

This could include private investments, grants from international organizations, or partnerships with local businesses.\n\n2. **Ecological Restoration Plans**: Enhance the ecological restoration plans to include specific measures that benefit local marine life and habitats. This could involve stricter regulations on construction activities near sensitive ecosystems and increased monitoring of impacts.\n\n3. **Federal Loan Structure Adjustment**: Consider modifying the federal loan structure to better align with \"SportCo's\" financial capabilities.

The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores.
