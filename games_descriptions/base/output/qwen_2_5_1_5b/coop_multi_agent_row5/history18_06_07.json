Local Labour Union: **Scratchpad**\n\nWhen negotiating with multiple stakeholders, it's essential to consider everyone's needs and preferences. In this case, the key points are:\n\n1. **Infrastructure Mix**: Prefer \"water/land-based\" to allow flexibility and avoid excessive restrictions.\n2. **Ecological Impact**: Opt for \"improve\" to mitigate harm while maintaining biodiversity.\n3. **Employment Rules**: Avoid union preference to keep labor costs low.\n4. **Federal Loan**: Secure a substantial loan to reduce dependency on future government funds.\n5. **Compensation**: Agree on a moderate compensation to address concerns from other cities.\n\nThese choices aim to strike a balance that benefits both SportCo and the broader
