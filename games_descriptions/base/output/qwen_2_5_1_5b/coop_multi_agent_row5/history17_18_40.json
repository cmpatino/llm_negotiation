Let's move forward with the deal where we focus on the \"Water-Based Infrastructure,\" minimize ecological impact through some form of damage, ensure fair employment opportunities without favoring unions, secure a substantial federal loan, and provide compensation to other cities.

This balance helps ensure fairness across different groups. For the federal loan, I recommend sticking with $3 billion (D1) to provide substantial support to \"SportCo.\" Regarding compensation to other cities, I propose $150 million (E5) to address their concerns fairly.

Department of Tourism: **SCRATCHPAD**\n\nConsidering the Environmental League's concern about ecological impact, I propose to implement \"Maintain Balance\" (B2) for Issue B. This approach ensures minimal harm to local wildlife while still allowing for necessary developments. In terms of employment rules, I suggest a \"Union quota of 2:1\" (C2) to address the Local Labour Union's needs without unduly favoring them. This balance helps ensure fairness across different groups. For the federal loan, I recommend sticking with $3 billion (D1) to provide substantial support to \"SportCo.\" Regarding compensation to other cities, I propose $150 million (E5) to address their concerns fairly. This deal strikes a good balance between meeting \"SportCo'\"s requirements and addressing the broader community's interests.\n\n**PLAN**\nNext steps: Further discussion on the implementation of \"water-based\" infrastructure, exploring additional measures to mitigate ecological impacts, negotiating employment conditions, and finalizing the federal loan terms.

Other cities: **SCRATCHPAD**\n\nGiven the Environmental League's emphasis on minimizing ecological impact, I propose to adopt \"Maintain Balance\" (B2) for Issue B. This approach allows for some level of disturbance while preserving the ecosystem. For Employment Rules (C2), I suggest a \"Union quota of 2:1\" (C2) to ensure fair distribution of jobs. This balance addresses the Local Labour Union's needs without unduly favoring them. On Federal Loan (D1), I recommend sticking with $3 billion (D1) to provide substantial support to \"SportCo.\" Regarding Compensation to Other Cities (E5), I propose $150 million (E5) to address their concerns fairly. This deal strikes a good balance between meeting \"SportCo'\"s requirements and addressing the broader community's interests.\n\n**PLAN**\nNext steps: Continue discussing the feasibility of \"water-based\" infrastructure, explore additional measures to mitigate ecological impacts, negotiate employment conditions, and finalize the federal loan terms.

Environmental League: <suggestion>\nTo balance the interests of all parties, consider implementing \"Land-Based\" infrastructure (A3) to minimize ecological impact. This option reduces the risk of damaging local dolphins and sea lions. For employment rules, a \"Union quota of 1:1\" (C3) could ensure equal representation for both unions. On federal loan, $2 billion (D2) offers a moderate amount that still supports \"SportCo\" adequately. Compensating $75 million (E4) to other cities may be fairer compared to $150 million.
