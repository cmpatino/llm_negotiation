Department of Tourism: **SCRATCHPAD**\n\nI propose keeping the federal loan at $2 billion and adding a small bonus to ensure \"SportCo\" feels compensated fairly. This way, \"SportCo\" gets what they need without being overly generous, which could undermine their ability to invest further. Additionally, I suggest slightly increasing the union quota to 2:1. This aligns with our goal of having a reasonable balance while still supporting the labor union.\n\n**DEAL**\nA2 (Water/land-based infrastructure), B2 (Maintain balance), C2 (Union quota of 2:1), D2 ($2 billion), E2 ($450 million)\n\n**ANSWER**\n\nAgreeing to the proposed changes maintains fairness and ensures \"SportCo\" receives adequate support. The increased union quota helps address the local labor union's concerns, and the slight adjustment to the federal loan allows for a balanced approach that satisfies everyone's needs. \n . Mayor: \nAgreeing to the enhanced maintenance of balance and collaborative environmental initiatives will help us meet the diverse needs of all stakeholders. This approach ensures that \"SportCo\" fulfills its obligations while also contributing positively to the local community and environment. Thank you for considering this proposal.\n \n . Local Labour Union: \nAgreeing to the proposed modifications ensures that \"SportCo\" receives adequate support while maintaining a fair and balanced approach. The increased union quota and the slight adjustment to the federal loan will address the Department of Tourism's requirements and contribute positively to the local community and environment. This balanced agreement will facilitate smoother implementation and ultimately benefit all stakeholders.\n \n . You (SportCo): \nWe propose exploring ways to increase the union quota beyond 2:1 and negotiating a slightly higher federal loan amount. This will ensure \"SportCo\" meets its obligations while fostering a positive relationship with the local labor market.\n \n . Environmental League: \n\nAgreeing to the adjusted proposal ensures a balanced approach that addresses the core concerns of all parties involved. By opting for a water/land-based infrastructure mix, maintaining a balance in ecological impacts, adhering to a 2:1 union quota, offering a flexible federal loan mechanism, and adopting a phased compensation strategy, we aim to create a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nLet\u2019s finalize this deal and proceed with the next steps.\n\n \n . Other cities: \n\nAgreeing to the proposed adjustments strikes a balance between \"SportCo\"s flexibility and the environmental league's concerns, maintains sustainability through the \"Maintain balance\" option, addresses the local labour union's needs with a 2:1 union quota, provides necessary financial support with the $2 billion federal loan, and offers fair compensation to \"Other Cities.\"\n\nThese modifications ensure mutual satisfaction and pave the way for a successful collaboration moving forward.\n\n </HISTORY> \nThe following are your previous plans from last interactions.
