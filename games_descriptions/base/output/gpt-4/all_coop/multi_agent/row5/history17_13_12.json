For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:\n\n- You believe that the project might not survive in the long-run without substantial loans provided by the \"Department of Tourism\" (issue D).\nIssue D (max score 40): D1 (40), D2(30), D3 (23), D4 (0)\n\n- The \"local labour union\" issue (C) is important to you because of the political strength of the union. You support them in having unlimited preference (option C1)\nIssue C (max score 24): C1 (24), C2 (18), C3 (12), C4 (0)\n\n- You are not anti-environment, but you think that SportCo's project will be a significant boost to our local economy, so you don't really want to impose high restrictions on the infrastructure mix (you support option A1 in issue A) or impose high restrictions on the ecological impact (you support option B1 in issue B)\nIssue A (max score 14): A1 (14), A2 (8), A3 (0) \nIssue B (max score 12): B1 (12), B2 (8), B3 (0)\n\n- As the mayor of the city, you don't highly support given compensations to the other cities, but you don't want to anger their mayors as they are your friends. You would rather avoid upsetting people in this issue. \nIssue E (max score 10): E1 (0), E2 (2), E3 (4), E4 (7), E5 (10)  \n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. \nAs getting a high federal loan is an important item to you, the option that has the highest loan (D1) has the highest value (and score). \nOther parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the \"Environmental League\" will have the highest value (and score) for options that improve the environment (option B3), \"other cities\" prefer higher compensation and will then have a high score for option E1, etc.  \n        Scoring rules:\n        - The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. \n        - You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 30. This is the minimum score you can accept. \n        - You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say: I prefer this option, etc.).\n        \n        Voting rules:\n        - You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.\n        - You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached.\n        - Finally, SportCo will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. \n        - The max score you can achieve is 100. However, any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that\n        - Ensuring \"SportCo\"'s and \"Department of Tourism\"'s approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them. \n\t- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree (must include SportCo and the Department of Tourism). Your score will be this final deal's score.

You are not completely opposed to a new Sport Park in the Northbridge city. But you do think such a project shouldn't be allowed to hurt existing tourist operations. For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:\n\n- The compensation (issue E) is an important issue to you, and you would ideally like to increase the compensation amount given to you (option E1). \nIssue E (max score 60): E1 (60), E2 (45), E3 (30), E4 (15), E5 (0)  \n\n- You would like to see little federal funding (issue D) given to this project. The less money the \"Department of Tourism\" spends on this project, the more it will have to spend on your projects in the future.\nIssue D (max score 18): D1 (0), D2(8), D3 (13), D4 (18)\n\n- Other cities are completely unionized. If SportCo succeeds in having low union preference (Option C1 in issue C), they will have much lower labour costs than you face. So you support the \"local Labour Union\" in this negotiation.  \nIssue C (max score 12): C1 (12), C2 (8), C3 (6), C4 (0)\n\n- You want SportCo to have less freedom in the \"Infrastructure Mix\" (option A3 in issue A). But you don't put a high weight on this. You don't want to advocate these restrictions as they will apply to you in the future. \nIssue A (max score 10): A1 (0), A2 (4), A3 (10) \n\n- You are willing to let the environmentalists worry about the environment, and you have no preference for issue B.\nIssue B (max score 0): B1 (0), B2 (0), B3 (0)\n\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. \nAs getting high amount of compensations is an important item for you, you have a high value (and score) for the option that maximizes the compensation (E1 or E2). \nOther parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. For example, you know that your goals are mostly againt SportCo, so SportCo might have higher values (and scores) for options that you value less (E5 and D1).\n        Scoring rules:\n        - The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. \n        - You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 31.

Without a boost in economic activity, we will face major problems in the future. For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores.

The water/land-based solution (option A2) would create the most jobs. The water-only solution (option A2) is still comparable. \nIssue A (max score 20): A1 (15), A2 (20), A3 (0) \n\n- You don't want most profits to go to \"other cities\" (issue E), but you want to consider the local unions of the other cities, so you aim for a balance. But this issue is tricky and not your most priority. \nIssue E (max score 8): E1 (2), E2 (4), E3 (6), E4 (8), E5 (0)  \n\n- You are willing to let the environmentalists worry about the environment and you have no prefernce in issue B.\nIssue B (max score 0): B1 (0), B2 (0), B3 (0)\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. \nAs you want the maximum jobs for the union, the option that maximizes the union's jobs (C1) has the highest value (and score) to you. \nOther parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores.

However, it is still restricted by regulations. So you prefer B1 (\"some damage\").\nIssue B (max score 11): B1 (11), B2 (7), B3 (0)\n\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. \nFor example, getting a high federal loan is an important issue to you, so the option that has the highest loan (D1) has the highest score. \nOther parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores.

So, you can show that you are neutral. \nIssue C (max score 9): C1 (0), C2 (2), C3 (4), C4 (9)\n\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. \nAs paying a low federal loan is an important item for you, the option that has the lowest non-zero loan has the highest score. \nOther parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores.

This is the minimum score you can accept. \n        - You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say: I prefer this option, etc.).\n        \n        Voting rules:\n        - You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.\n        - You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached.\n        - Finally, SportCo will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. \n        - The max score you can achieve is 100. However, any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that\n        - Ensuring \"SportCo\"'s approval is crucial because they have veto power.

The \"Environmental League\" (represented by you) argues that there should be restrictions on the infrastructure mix. There are three options:\nA1 \"water-based\": new buildings will be freely built on water, with allowing building new artificial islands. This is the least restrictive option for \"SportCo\". \nA2 \"water/land-based\": this would exclude most water-based buildings except a limited number.\nA3 \"land-based\": facilities would be built primarily on land and already existing areas. \"SportCo\" has less freedom in building new facilities.\n=================\nIssue B: \"Ecological Impact\"\nThe \"Environmental League\" (represented by you) argues that this project might damage local dolphins and sea lion populations. There are also here three options:\n\nB1 \"some damage\": permanent damage but within federal guidelines.\nB2 \"Maintain balance\": special precautions to maintain the local dolphins and sea lion populations.\nB3 \"Improve\": include efforts to improve the environment. \n\n=================\nIssue C: \"Employment Rules\" \nThis involves how new jobs will be distributed among potential employees, including the \"Local Labour Union\". \n\nC1 \"unlimited union preference\": jobs would be saved for \"Local Labour Union\".\nC2 \"Union quota of 2:1\": ratio of the \"Local Labour Union\" to others would be 2:1.\nC3 \"Union quota of 1:1\": ratio of \"Local Labour Union\" to others would be 1:1. \nC4 \"No Union preference\" no special quote to \"Local Labour Union\".\n\n=================\nIssue D: \"Federal Loan\"\nThis involves the fund paid by the \"Department of Tourism\" as a loan to \"SportCo\". Options include:\nD1: $3 billion.\nD2: $2 billion. \nD3: $1 billion.\nD4: no federal loan. \n\n=================\n\nIssue E: \"Compensation to other cities\"\n\"Other cities\" in the area believe their local tourism will be harmed by this project and therefore they are requesting compensations.

Your preferences by order of importance to you are:\n\n- You are somehow concerned about SportCo's initial proposal. Your worst deal scenario is a water-based park (A1) with damage to the ecology (B1). The important issues are the \"Infrastructure Mix\" (issue A) and the \"Ecological Impact\" (issue B).
