Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make a proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n         \n                After the final answer, building on your current move and analysis, \n                briefly write down short notes for yourself of what exact options you can explore the next time you speak. \n                Enclose the notes between <PLAN> and </PLAN>.

following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n\nFor the next turn, I will focus on finding a compromise on the employment rules and explore options that balance the needs of the local labour union and other parties. I will also continue to emphasize the importance of the federal loan and work towards finding a solution that meets SportCo's needs while addressing the concerns of the other parties. </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk.Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \nIn your scratchpad, \n \n            1) Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make a proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores.
