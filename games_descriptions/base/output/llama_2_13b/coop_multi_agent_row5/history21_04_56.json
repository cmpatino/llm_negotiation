I will also pay close attention to the Department of Tourism's preferences and try to find a solution that satisfies their concerns. I will also explore option A1 for the infrastructure mix to see if it can provide more job opportunities for the Local Labour Union.\n\n </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk.
