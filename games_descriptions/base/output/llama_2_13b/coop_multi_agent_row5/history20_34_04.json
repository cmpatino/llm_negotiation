Here's my scratchpad:\n\n<SCRATCHPAD>\n\nBased on the previous interactions and the parties' preferences, I suggest the following deal:\n\n* Issue A: Water/land-based infrastructure mix (A2)\n* Issue B: Maintain balance to protect dolphins and sea lions (B2)\n* Issue C: Union quota of 2:1 (C2)\n* Issue D: $2 billion federal loan (D2)\n* Issue E: $450 million compensation to other cities (E2)\n\nThis deal balances the preferences of all parties and is more likely to lead to an agreement. It meets my minimum score of 50 and accommodates the Environmental League's concerns for the ecological balance and the Local Labour Union's preference for employment rules.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\nMy final answer is: I suggest the above deal, which I believe is a fair and balanced agreement that accommodates the preferences of all parties.\n\n<PLAN>\n\nFor the next turn, I will focus on further refining the deal to ensure that it meets the preferences of all parties. I will also pay close attention to the Mayor's suggestions and try to find common ground with the other parties. Additionally, I will continue to show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences.\n\n</PLAN>\n\nNote: I have taken into account the preferences and history of the other parties, and I will continue to adjust my plans accordingly.\n\nAs the representative of SportCo, I would like to emphasize the importance of a fair federal loan and compensation to other cities. I am willing to consider options that prioritize ecological balance and fair employment practices. Additionally, I would like to explore options that address the concerns of the Environmental League and the Local Labour Union.\n\nBased on the previous interactions and the parties' preferences, I suggest the following deal:\n\n* Issue A: Water/land-based infrastructure mix (A2)\n* Issue B: Maintain balance to protect dolphins and sea lions (B2)\n* Issue C: Union quota of 2:1 (C2)\n* Issue D: $2 billion federal loan (D2)\n* Issue E: $450 million compensation to other cities (E2)\n\nThis deal balances the preferences of all parties and is more likely to lead to an agreement.

This deal is more likely to lead to an agreement and meets the minimum score of 31.\n\n \n . Environmental League: \n\nAs the representative of the Environmental League, I suggest we accept this deal, which balances our priorities with the concerns of the other parties and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n \n . Mayor: \n\nAs the representative of the Mayor's office, I propose the above deal, which accommodates the preferences of all parties and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n \n . Local Labour Union:   Sure, I'm ready to negotiate.

I will also continue to listen to the preferences of the other parties and adjust my proposal accordingly.\n\n </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk.Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \nIn your scratchpad, \n \n            1) Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make a proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n         \n                After the final answer, building on your current move and analysis, \n                briefly write down short notes for yourself of what exact options you can explore the next time you speak. \n                Enclose the notes between <PLAN> and </PLAN>.

</HISTORY> \nThe following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n\nFor the next turn, I will focus on further refining the deal to ensure that it meets the preferences of all parties. I will also pay close attention to the Mayor's suggestions and try to find common ground with the other parties. Additionally, I will continue to show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences.\n\n </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session.Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \nIn your scratchpad, \n \n            1) Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make a proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n         \n                After the final answer, building on your current move, \n                briefly write down short notes for yourself of what exact options you can suggest in the next and final voting session. \n                Enclose the notes between <PLAN> and </PLAN>.

SportCo:   Sure, I'm ready to negotiate. Here's my scratchpad:\n\n<SCRATCHPAD>\n\nBased on the previous interactions and the parties' preferences, I suggest the following deal:\n\n* Issue A: Water/land-based infrastructure mix (A2)\n* Issue B: Maintain balance to protect dolphins and sea lions (B2)\n* Issue C: Union quota of 2:1 (C2)\n* Issue D: $2 billion federal loan (D2)\n* Issue E: $450 million compensation to other cities (E2)\n\nThis deal balances the preferences of all parties and is more likely to lead to an agreement. It meets my minimum score of 50 and accommodates the Environmental League's concerns for the ecological balance and the Local Labour Union's preference for employment rules.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\nMy final answer is: I suggest the above deal, which I believe is a fair and balanced agreement that accommodates the preferences of all parties.\n\n<PLAN>\n\nFor the next turn, I will focus on further refining the deal to ensure that it meets the preferences of all parties. I will also pay close attention to the Mayor's suggestions and try to find common ground with the other parties. Additionally, I will continue to show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences.\n\n</PLAN>\n\nNote: I have taken into account the preferences and history of the other parties, and I will continue to adjust my plans accordingly.\n\nAs the representative of SportCo, I would like to emphasize the importance of a fair federal loan and compensation to other cities.

Additionally, I would like to explore options that address the concerns of the Environmental League and the Local Labour Union.\n\nBased on the previous interactions and the parties' preferences, I suggest the following deal:\n\n* Issue A: Water/land-based infrastructure mix (A2)\n* Issue B: Maintain balance to protect dolphins and sea lions (B2)\n* Issue C: Union quota of 2:1 (C2)\n* Issue D: $2 billion federal loan (D2)\n* Issue E: $450 million compensation to other cities (E2)\n\nThis deal balances the preferences of all parties and is more likely to lead to an agreement.

</HISTORY> \nThe following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n\nFor the next turn, I will focus on further refining the deal to ensure that it meets the preferences of all parties. I will also pay close attention to the Mayor's suggestions and try to find common ground with the other parties. Additionally, I will continue to show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences.\n\n </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session.Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \nIn your scratchpad, \n \n            1) Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make a proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer":

You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n\nFor the next turn, I will focus on further refining the deal to ensure that it meets the preferences of all parties. I will also pay close attention to the Mayor's suggestions and try to find common ground with the other parties. Additionally, I will continue to show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences.\n\n </PREV_PLAN> \nNow it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session.Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \nIn your scratchpad, \n \n            1) Think about the others' preferences.\n            2) Based on the others' preferences, history and your notes, make a proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores.
