", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nTo start, let's analyze the initial proposal made by SportCo: A1, B1, C4, D1, E5. This proposal seems to heavily favor SportCo's interests, particularly with the $3 billion federal loan (D1) and no compensation to other cities (E5). However, it does not align well with my priorities, especially concerning environmental impact (B1 allows for some damage) and infrastructure mix (A1 is water-based, which I prefer to avoid due to environmental concerns).\n\nGiven the other parties' likely preferences:\n- The Environmental League will likely oppose B1 due to its potential for ecological damage and might prefer A3 for less environmental impact.\n- The Local Labour Union will likely oppose C4 as it offers no union preference.\n- Other cities will strongly oppose E5, as it offers no compensation.\n- SportCo's preference for D1 indicates they value a significant federal loan, but I aim to reduce this amount.\n\nMy goal is to find a balance that accommodates these concerns while meeting my minimum score threshold. I need to prioritize issues that are crucial to me and other parties, focusing on finding common ground, especially with SportCo, given their veto power.\n\nConsidering these factors, a potential compromise could involve:\n- A more environmentally friendly option for B (B2 or B3) to appease the Environmental League and myself.\n- A moderate infrastructure mix (A2) that allows for some freedom in development while considering environmental impacts.\n- A federal loan that is less than $3 billion but still significant (D2 or D3) to appease SportCo while aligning with my preference for a lower loan.\n- Some form of compensation to other cities (E3 seems like a fair middle ground) to address their concerns.\n- For employment rules, given it's a minor issue for me, showing flexibility around C2 or C3 could help appease the Local Labour Union without significantly impacting my score.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances environmental concerns, infrastructure development, and financial support: <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E3</DEAL>.

Specifically, I can consider adjusting the infrastructure mix to A3 if it means SportCo would accept a lower loan amount, such as D3, and potentially revising the employment rules to C3 if the Local Labour Union presses for more favorable terms.

The Local Labour Union's employment rules are also a point of discussion, with C2 being a frequently proposed option. Other cities are seeking compensation, with E2 and E3 being the most commonly proposed options. \n\nGiven the history of proposals, it seems that A2 is a widely accepted option for the infrastructure mix. My own preferences prioritize a lower federal loan, with D3 being the most desirable option for me. I also want to ensure that the environmental impact is minimized, and the compensation to other cities is reasonable.\n\nConsidering these factors, I can propose a deal that balances the interests of all parties. Since SportCo has veto power, it's essential to accommodate their desires while also addressing the concerns of other parties. I can suggest a deal that includes A2 for the infrastructure mix, B2 for the ecological impact, C2 for employment rules, D3 for the federal loan, and E3 for compensation to other cities.\n\nThis proposal aims to find a middle ground that satisfies the primary concerns of all parties involved. By offering a lower federal loan, I can meet my own objectives while also addressing SportCo's desire for significant financial support.

From the history, it's clear that most parties are leaning towards a compromise on issue A, with A2 being the most commonly proposed option. This aligns with my goal of reducing environmental harm, as A2 restricts water-based buildings more than A1 but less than A3. \n\nFor issue B, maintaining a balance (B2) seems to be the middle ground that most parties can agree on, which is a step in the right direction for environmental concerns but doesn't fully meet my preference for improving the environment (B3). However, given the importance of reaching an agreement, B2 is a compromise I can live with.\n\nIssues C, D, and E seem to be points of contention among the other parties, with various proposals for employment rules, federal loans, and compensation to other cities. Since my scores for these issues are 0, I am flexible and can accommodate the preferences of other parties to reach a consensus. \n\nGiven SportCo's initial proposal and their veto power, along with the Department of Tourism's influence, it's crucial to ensure their interests are addressed while still considering environmental concerns. The Local Labour Union's and Other cities' proposals also need to be taken into account to ensure a balanced agreement.\n\nConsidering all these factors, a proposal that balances the interests of all parties, especially focusing on the common ground found in the discussions, would be essential. A deal that includes A2 for infrastructure mix, B2 for ecological impact, and finds a middle ground for C, D, and E that satisfies the majority could be viable.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances the interests of all parties: <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E3</DEAL>.
