This proposal seems to heavily favor SportCo's interests, particularly with the choice of A1 for infrastructure mix, which gives them the most freedom in development, and E5, which means no compensation to other cities. However, it does offer a significant federal loan (D1), which is beneficial for the project's success and aligns with my interests as well.\n\nConsidering the preferences of other parties:\n- The Environmental League would likely oppose B1 due to its potential ecological impact.\n- The Local Labour Union (myself) would strongly disagree with C4, as it offers no union preference, significantly impacting job distribution.\n- Other cities would not accept E5, as it denies them any compensation.\n- The Department of Tourism might be satisfied with D1, as it involves a substantial loan.\n\nGiven these considerations, a balanced proposal needs to address the concerns of all parties while aiming for a win-win situation. Since my primary interest lies in employment rules, I need to negotiate for a better option than C4. The federal loan is also crucial, so maintaining D1 would be beneficial. For infrastructure mix, A2 could be a compromise, offering a balance between development freedom and environmental concerns. For ecological impact, considering the Environmental League's concerns, B2 or B3 might be more acceptable. Lastly, for compensation to other cities, a moderate option like E3 could be a compromise.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances the interests of all parties: <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D1, E3</DEAL>.

I could also consider compromising on the infrastructure mix if it means securing a better deal on employment rules or federal loan.

SportCo's initial proposal includes A1, B1, C4, D1, and E5, which seems to prioritize their own interests, particularly in terms of infrastructure freedom and federal loan, but neglects compensation to other cities and union preferences. The Local Labour Union's proposal, A2, B2, C2, D1, E3, attempts to balance various interests, including a more moderate infrastructure mix, ecological considerations, a union quota, and some compensation to other cities.\n\nGiven my priorities, I need to focus on increasing compensation (Issue E) and reducing federal funding (Issue D), while also considering the interests of other parties to reach a balanced agreement. The Local Labour Union's proposal is more aligned with my goals than SportCo's, especially regarding compensation and union quotas. However, I would like to see a reduction in the federal loan and possibly a more restrictive infrastructure mix to protect our interests and the environment.\n\nConsidering the need for a balanced agreement and the veto power of SportCo and the Department of Tourism, I should aim to find common ground that satisfies these key parties while advancing my own interests. Since the Department of Tourism is involved in the federal loan, their preference might lean towards providing some level of funding, but perhaps not the maximum amount. SportCo's initial proposal suggests they prefer a significant loan and freedom in infrastructure development.\n\nMy strategy should be to build upon the Local Labour Union's proposal, adjusting it to better reflect my priorities and potentially appeal more to SportCo and the Department of Tourism.

Additionally, I will pay close attention to the responses from SportCo and the Department of Tourism to understand their flexibility regarding the federal loan and infrastructure development.

", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nConsidering the history of proposals, it's clear that most parties are converging on a balanced infrastructure mix (A2) and maintaining ecological balance (B2), with a union quota (C2) and a significant federal loan (D2). The Environmental League and the Department of Tourism seem to prioritize ecological balance and a balanced infrastructure mix, while SportCo aims for a compromise that satisfies most parties. The Mayor has proposed various deals, indicating flexibility. My primary goal is to maximize compensation (E) while minimizing the federal loan (D). Given the consistent proposal of D2 and the importance of reaching an agreement, I may need to compromise on D2 for a better E option. Noting the repetition of E3 in proposals, I might aim to negotiate for E2, which would be a significant improvement for me without completely disregarding the concerns of other parties. Since my minimum score must be met, and I prioritize compensation, I will focus on adjusting the proposal to include E2, potentially compromising on A or B if necessary, to ensure a balanced agreement that meets my minimum requirements.\n\nGiven the preferences and the aim for a balanced agreement, proposing a deal that includes A2 (to satisfy the infrastructure mix concerns), B2 (for ecological balance), C2 (union quota), D2 (as a compromise on the federal loan), and E2 (to maximize compensation) could be a viable path forward.

The main points of contention seem to be the federal loan amount and the employment rules. SportCo and several other parties have proposed D2, but given my preference for a lower loan amount, I should try to negotiate for D3. For employment rules, there's a variety of proposals, but since my preference is for no union preference (C4), I should explore options that could lead to a compromise, possibly discussing C3 as a middle ground. The Environmental League's initial proposal and the consensus around A2 suggest that this option is palatable to most, so it's less of a point for negotiation. The ecological impact option B2 also seems to be a point of agreement among many parties. \n\nGiven these observations, a proposal that balances between my scores and accommodating others could involve A2, B2, a compromise on C, D3, and E3. Since my minimum score threshold is crucial, and I aim for a win-win situation, being flexible on the employment rules while pushing for a lower federal loan could be key.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that includes A2, B2, C3, D3, and E3, aiming to balance the infrastructure mix, maintain ecological balance, provide a reasonable union quota, offer a significant yet reduced federal loan, and compensate other cities fairly.
