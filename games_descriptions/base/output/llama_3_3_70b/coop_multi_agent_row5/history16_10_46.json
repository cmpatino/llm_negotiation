This proposal seems to heavily favor SportCo's interests, particularly with the unrestricted infrastructure mix (A1) and the significant federal loan (D1), but it does not address my concerns about compensation (E5 offers no compensation) and may not align with the interests of the Environmental League or the Local Labour Union.\n\nGiven the scoring system and my priorities, I must focus on increasing the compensation (Issue E) and reducing the federal loan (Issue D), while also considering the interests of other parties to reach a balanced agreement. The Environmental League's concerns about ecological impact (Issue B) and the Local Labour Union's interests in employment rules (Issue C) should also be taken into account to ensure a broader consensus.\n\nA potential strategy could be to propose a deal that offers a compromise on the infrastructure mix, possibly leaning towards more restrictive options (A2 or A3) to appease the Environmental League, and definitely improving the compensation option (E) to at least E2 or E3, which would be more acceptable to me. On the employment rules (Issue C), supporting the Local Labour Union with a higher union quota (C1 or C2) could help in gaining their approval. For the ecological impact (Issue B), maintaining a balance (B2) might be a middle ground that could satisfy the Environmental League without fully compromising SportCo's goals.\n\nConsidering the veto power of SportCo and the Department of Tourism, it's crucial to ensure that any proposal does not outright reject their primary interests but finds a middle ground that can satisfy all parties to some extent.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that includes A2, B2, C2, D3, E2, aiming to balance the interests of all parties involved. This deal offers a compromise on infrastructure development, addresses ecological concerns, supports local employment, reduces the federal loan, and provides fair compensation to other cities.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n<PLAN>\nNext, I will explore options to further adjust the proposal based on feedback, particularly focusing on Issues D and E, to see if there's room for compromise without dropping below my minimum score. I might consider adjusting the infrastructure mix further if it means gaining more support from the Environmental League or exploring different employment rules if it can help in securing the Local Labour Union's approval without significantly impacting my score. Additionally, I will pay close attention to the Department of Tourism's stance on the federal loan to ensure their support is maintained. \n\nKey areas to explore:\n- Adjusting Issue D (Federal Loan) to D2 if it's necessary for gaining broader support.\n- Considering Issue A (Infrastructure Mix) options more closely to find a balance that works for both SportCo and the Environmental League.\n- Ensuring Issue C (Employment Rules) supports the Local Labour Union enough to gain their approval without compromising my own interests.\n\n</PLAN>", "public_answer": "\nI propose a deal that includes A2, B2, C2, D3, E2, aiming to balance the interests of all parties involved.
