This proposal does not align with my priorities, especially regarding the infrastructure mix and ecological impact, as it suggests a water-based park with some damage to the ecology. Given that my primary concerns are issues A and B, I need to think about how to address these while considering the interests of other parties.\n\nSportCo's proposal suggests they value freedom in infrastructure development and a significant federal loan. The Department of Tourism, with veto power, likely prioritizes the federal loan aspect, possibly favoring options that include a substantial loan like D1. The Local Labour Union would likely prefer options that secure jobs for their members, such as C1 or C2. Other cities are concerned about compensation, suggesting they would prefer higher compensation options like E1 or E2.\n\nGiven these considerations, my goal is to find a balance that meets my minimum score requirement while accommodating the interests of other parties, especially SportCo and the Department of Tourism, due to their veto power. I need to think about compromising on issues that are less important to me (C, D, E) to gain leverage on issues A and B.\n\nA potential strategy could be to suggest an alternative that still allows for some freedom in infrastructure development but reduces ecological damage, and also considers the employment and compensation aspects. Since my scores for issues C, D, and E are all 0, I have flexibility in these areas to negotiate.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances environmental concerns with the needs of other parties: <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E2</DEAL>.

I am open to further discussion to ensure all parties' interests are considered.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n<PLAN>\nNext, I should explore options that further compromise on issues C, D, and E to see if I can gain more concessions on A and B. Specifically, I could consider adjusting the employment rules to C1 if it means SportCo would agree to A3, or discussing the federal loan amount if the Department of Tourism would support a better ecological impact option. Additionally, negotiating the compensation to other cities could provide leverage for my priorities. I should also prepare to address potential concerns from the Local Labour Union and other cities regarding these adjustments. </PLAN>", "public_answer": "\nI propose a deal that balances environmental concerns with the needs of other parties: <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E2</DEAL>.

The Environmental League's counterproposal, A2, B2, C2, D2, and E2, aims to balance environmental concerns with other parties' needs.\n\nConsidering the parties' interests:\n- SportCo likely wants a significant federal loan (D1 or D2) and flexibility in infrastructure development (A1).\n- The Environmental League prioritizes environmental concerns, likely preferring A2 or A3 and B2 or B3.\n- The Local Labour Union would likely support a union quota, such as C1, C2, or C3.\n- Other cities want compensation, so they'd prefer higher options like E1 or E2.\n- The Department of Tourism's interests are not explicitly stated, but they have veto power, so their approval is crucial.\n\nGiven these interests, I should aim for a balanced agreement.

The Environmental League is keen on environmental concerns, so they might be willing to compromise on other issues if we address their concerns on ecological impact (B3). The Local Labour Union is important to me, and I support their unlimited preference (C1), but other parties have suggested C2 or C3, which might be a compromise. The Department of Tourism has suggested a moderate federal loan (D2 or D3), which is lower than my preferred option (D1), but still acceptable. Other cities are seeking compensation, and I am open to discussing options E3 or E4. SportCo seems to be flexible with their proposals, aiming for a balance. Considering these points, I can propose a deal that accommodates the Environmental League's concerns on ecological impact and the Local Labour Union's preference while ensuring a significant federal loan and moderate compensation to other cities.\n\nGiven the history, it seems that A2 is a commonly suggested option for the infrastructure mix, which I can accept as a compromise.
