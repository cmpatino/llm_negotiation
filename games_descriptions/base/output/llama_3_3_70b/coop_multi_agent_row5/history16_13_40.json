This proposal seems to heavily favor SportCo's interests, particularly with the $3 billion federal loan (D1) and no compensation to other cities (E5). However, it does not align well with my priorities, especially concerning environmental impact (B1 allows for some damage) and infrastructure mix (A1 is water-based, which I prefer to avoid due to environmental concerns).\n\nGiven the other parties' likely preferences:\n- The Environmental League will likely oppose B1 due to its potential for ecological damage and might prefer A3 for less environmental impact.\n- The Local Labour Union will likely oppose C4 as it offers no union preference.\n- Other cities will strongly oppose E5, as it offers no compensation.\n- SportCo's preference for D1 indicates they value a significant federal loan, but I aim to reduce this amount.\n\nMy goal is to find a balance that accommodates these concerns while meeting my minimum score threshold. I need to prioritize issues that are crucial to me and other parties, focusing on finding common ground, especially with SportCo, given their veto power.\n\nConsidering these factors, a potential compromise could involve:\n- A more environmentally friendly option for B (B2 or B3) to appease the Environmental League and myself.\n- A moderate infrastructure mix (A2) that allows for some freedom in development while considering environmental impacts.\n- A federal loan that is less than $3 billion but still significant (D2 or D3) to appease SportCo while aligning with my preference for a lower loan.\n- Some form of compensation to other cities (E3 seems like a fair middle ground) to address their concerns.\n- For employment rules, given it's a minor issue for me, showing flexibility around C2 or C3 could help appease the Local Labour Union without significantly impacting my score.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances environmental concerns, infrastructure development, and financial support: <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E3</DEAL>.
