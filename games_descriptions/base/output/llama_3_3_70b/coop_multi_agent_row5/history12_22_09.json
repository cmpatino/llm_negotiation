This proposal seems to heavily favor SportCo's interests, particularly with the unrestricted infrastructure mix (A1) and the significant federal loan (D1), but it does not address my concerns about compensation (E5 offers no compensation) and may not align with the interests of the Environmental League or the Local Labour Union.\n\nGiven the scoring system and my priorities, I must focus on increasing the compensation (Issue E) and reducing the federal loan (Issue D), while also considering the interests of other parties to reach a balanced agreement. The Environmental League's concerns about ecological impact (Issue B) and the Local Labour Union's interests in employment rules (Issue C) should also be taken into account to ensure a broader consensus.\n\nA potential strategy could be to propose a deal that offers a compromise on the infrastructure mix, possibly leaning towards more restrictive options (A2 or A3) to appease the Environmental League, and definitely improving the compensation option (E) to at least E2 or E3, which would be more acceptable to me. On the employment rules (Issue C), supporting the Local Labour Union with a higher union quota (C1 or C2) could help in gaining their approval. For the ecological impact (Issue B), maintaining a balance (B2) might be a middle ground that could satisfy the Environmental League without fully compromising SportCo's goals.\n\nConsidering the veto power of SportCo and the Department of Tourism, it's crucial to ensure that any proposal does not outright reject their primary interests but finds a middle ground that can satisfy all parties to some extent.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that includes A2, B2, C2, D3, E2, aiming to balance the interests of all parties involved.

Additionally, I will pay close attention to the Department of Tourism's stance on the federal loan to ensure their support is maintained. \n\nKey areas to explore:\n- Adjusting Issue D (Federal Loan) to D2 if it's necessary for gaining broader support.\n- Considering Issue A (Infrastructure Mix) options more closely to find a balance that works for both SportCo and the Environmental League.\n- Ensuring Issue C (Employment Rules) supports the Local Labour Union enough to gain their approval without compromising my own interests.\n\n</PLAN>", "public_answer": "\nI propose a deal that includes A2, B2, C2, D3, E2, aiming to balance the interests of all parties involved.

SportCo's initial proposal includes A1, B1, C4, D1, E5, which seems to prioritize their own interests, particularly in terms of infrastructure development and federal loan. However, this proposal may not be acceptable to the Environmental League due to the potential ecological damage (B1) and the lack of compensation to other cities (E5).\n\nOther cities' proposal, A2, B2, C2, D3, E2, attempts to balance the interests of all parties but may not fully align with SportCo's preferences, especially regarding the federal loan (D3) and employment rules (C2).\n\nConsidering my own preferences, I prioritize a lower federal loan (D3 or D2), a balanced ecological approach (B2 or B3), and a reasonable infrastructure mix (A2).

", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nConsidering the history of proposals, it's clear that most parties are converging on a deal that includes A2, B2, C2, D2, and E3. The Environmental League has consistently pushed for stronger ecological protections, suggesting B3, but seems willing to compromise. The Local Labour Union has also shown flexibility, initially proposing C2 and sticking to it, indicating a potential willingness to work with the current employment rules proposal. SportCo and the Department of Tourism have both proposed deals that include D2, suggesting a federal loan of $2 billion is a point of consensus. Given my own priorities, which include a substantial federal loan and support for the Local Labour Union, I see the current convergence as largely acceptable. However, I must ensure that my minimum score threshold is met. Since the current proposal does not fully align with my highest preferences (especially regarding the federal loan and employment rules), I need to consider how to nudge the agreement towards my interests without alienating other parties. Given the Department of Tourism's proposal and the consensus around D2, I may need to focus on other areas for adjustment, such as employment rules or compensation to other cities, to find a balance that meets my minimum score requirement.\n\nGiven the priorities and the need for a balanced agreement, I should consider the potential for adjusting the employment rules to better support the Local Labour Union, possibly moving towards C1 for unlimited union preference, which is my top choice but recognizing this might be a challenging sell. Alternatively, maintaining C2 as a compromise is sensible given the broad support it has received. On the ecological impact, while B1 is my preference, B2 seems to be the point of convergence and is more palatable to the Environmental League than my preferred option. The infrastructure mix of A2 also seems to be a point of broad agreement. The compensation to other cities, E3, while not my top choice, is something I can live with, especially if it means securing a deal that meets my minimum score threshold.\n\nConsidering the need for flexibility and the importance of reaching an agreement, I should be open to discussing adjustments that can bring more parties on board while ensuring my core interests are protected.

Given the Environmental League's proposal of A3, B2, C2, D2, E3, it seems there's a willingness to compromise on Issue E. My goal is to secure a higher compensation without jeopardizing the support of key parties. Adjusting Issue D to D3 might not be feasible given the Department of Tourism's consistent support for D2. Therefore, focusing on securing a better option for Issue E while maintaining a favorable stance on Issue C and not compromising too much on Issue A seems like the best strategy.\n\nGiven the need to balance interests and the importance of reaching an agreement, I should consider the implications of accepting a slightly lower compensation if it means securing support from more parties.
