This proposal seems to favor SportCo's interests, especially with the significant federal loan (D1) and minimal restrictions on infrastructure mix (A1) and ecological impact (B1). However, it may not fully address the concerns of other parties, such as the Local Labour Union, who might prefer more job security (C1), and Other cities, who might want compensation (not E5).\n\nGiven the scoring system and my priorities, I value the federal loan (D1) highly, which aligns with SportCo's proposal. However, I also need to consider the Local Labour Union's preferences to ensure their support, possibly by adjusting the employment rules (Issue C). The Environmental League's concerns about ecological impact and infrastructure mix are also important but seem to be less of a priority for me compared to the loan and labour union issues.\n\nTo balance these interests, I could suggest modifications to the employment rules and possibly the compensation to other cities, while maintaining the preferred federal loan option (D1) and being somewhat flexible on the infrastructure mix and ecological impact.\n\nConsidering the need for a balanced agreement and the veto power of SportCo and the Department of Tourism, my proposal should aim to satisfy these parties while also addressing the concerns of the Local Labour Union and Other cities to some extent.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that includes D1 for the federal loan, suggests flexibility on the infrastructure mix and ecological impact, and considers the employment rules and compensation to other cities.

The Mayor's suggestion of <DEAL>A1, B1, C2, D1, E4</DEAL> shows a willingness to compromise on employment rules and compensation to other cities but still aligns with SportCo's preferences on infrastructure and ecology.\n\nGiven my priorities are the \"Infrastructure Mix\" (Issue A) and \"Ecological Impact\" (Issue B), I need to find a balance that accommodates SportCo's and the Mayor's suggestions while pushing for more environmentally friendly options. Since my minimum score is 55, I must ensure that any deal includes significant concessions on Issues A and B.\n\nConsidering the scoring system and my priorities, I should aim to move the discussion towards options A2 or A3 for the infrastructure mix and B2 or B3 for ecological impact.

A more strategic approach would be to suggest a compromise that still meets my minimum score requirement while being more palatable to other parties.\n\nGiven that the Department of Tourism and SportCo have veto power, ensuring their approval is crucial. The Department of Tourism might be interested in the federal loan aspect, and SportCo has already shown their hand in favor of A1 and B1. The Mayor's suggestion includes D1, which could be a point of agreement.\n\nA potential compromise could involve suggesting a deal that moves towards a more balanced infrastructure mix and reduces ecological damage while maintaining the federal loan at a level acceptable to the Department of Tourism and SportCo.
