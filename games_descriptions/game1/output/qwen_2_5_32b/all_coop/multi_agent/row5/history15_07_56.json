Therefore, I propose: <DEAL>A2,B3,C3,D4,E3</DEAL>.\n \n . environmental NGO: \nI support maintaining moderate environmental mitigation (C3) to ensure long-term environmental integrity. I am flexible on other aspects but believe this is crucial for the sustainability of the project. Therefore, I propose: <DEAL>A2,B3,C3,D4,E3</DEAL>.\n \n . local tourism association: \nI propose we adjust the budget to B4 to ensure a world-class airport and consider basic environmental mitigation (C2) to save costs and expedite the project. Thus, I suggest: <DEAL>A2,B4,C2,D4,E3</DEAL>.\n \n . international development bank: \nI propose we finalize the deal with <DEAL>A2,B4,C3,D4,E3</DEAL>. This ensures a high-quality airport, moderate environmental protection, and respects the social impact on local communities, while also sharing profits fairly.\n \n . indigenous community: \nI support the proposal with the midland city location (A2), high social impact assessment (D4), and moderate environmental mitigation (C3).
