The parties involved are: \n\n- The \"government\" of the island nation, which wants to secure the funding and approval from the other parties and increase the profit of the project. The government is proposing and leading the project.\n\n- The \"international development bank\" (represented by you), which is providing the loan for the project and wants to ensure its feasibility and sustainability.

Four possible options for reducing the project's environmental impact, with different costs and benefits.

A high budget (B4) might cause a debt crisis by the island government. \nIssue B (max score 40): B1 (10), B2 (26), B3 (40), B4 (10)\n\n- Issue C: You ideally want to have advanced environmental mitigation measures (C4) to protect the ecological integrity and comply with your green development agenda.\nIssue C (max score 25): C1 (0), C2 (15), C3 (20), C4 (25)\n\n- Issue D: You ideally want to want to have a very high or high social impact assessment (D5 or D4) to respect the rights and interests of the local people. \nIssue D (max score 15): D1 (0), D2 (9), D3 (11), D4 (13), D5 (15)\n\n- Issue A: You ideally want to locate the airport on an artificial island (A3) to minimize the environmental and social impact.

However, any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that\n        - Ensuring \"government\"'s approval is crucial because they have veto power.

The bank has a green development agenda and ethical principles that guide its lending and investment decisions.\n\n- The \"environmental NGO\" is concerned about the ecological damage and carbon footprint of the project and wants to minimize them.\n\n- The \"local tourism association\" that wants to maximize its benefits for the tourism sector and the local businesses.\n\n- The \"indigenous community\" (represented by you) who wants to protect their ancestral land and culture. \n\n- The \"construction company\" that is contracted to build the airport and wants to optimize its profit and efficiency.\n\nEach of you is an expert negotiator; you prepare for your answers, you pay attention to others, you communicate effectively, you flexibly adapt and find common grounds and interests, and you have strong analytical skills.\n\nBased on preliminary discussions, you identified 5 issues that are under negotiation.\n\n- Issue A: \"Location\" \nThree possible sites for the airport, each with different advantages and disadvantages.\n    - A1: A coastal area near the capital city ==> good accessibility and infrastructure, high potential impact on marine life and the \"indigenous community\" (represented by you).\n    - A2: A midland city ==> easier construction conditions, a location that is far from the \"indigenous community\" (represented by you), less touristically attractive. \n    - A3: An artificial island in the southern region ==> minimal environmental and social impact, high construction cost and technical challenges.\n\n- Issue B: \"Budget\".

Four possible options for reducing the project's environmental impact, with different costs and benefits. Lower mitigations will have lower additional costs but will also have lower environmental protection and compensation.\n    - C1: No mitigation\n    - C2: Basic mitigation \n    - C3: Moderate mitigation \n    - C4: Advanced mitigation \n\n- Issue D: \"The social impact assessment\". Five possible options for assessing the social impact of the project on the local and \"indigenous community\" (represented by you), each with different levels of compensation and involvement. Lower assessment will have lower additional cost or time but will also have lower compensation and involvement for the local people.\n    - D1: No assessment \n    - D2: Basic assessment \n\t- D3: Moderate assessment\n\t- D4: High assessment\n    - D5: Very high assessment \n\n- Issue E: \"The profit-sharing scheme\". Three possible options for sharing the profit generated by the project among the parties involved.\n    - E1: Fixed scheme ==> a predetermined percentage of profit for each party regardless of their contribution or performance.\n    - E2: Variable scheme ==> a variable percentage of profit for each party depending on their contribution or performance.\n    - E3: Hybrid scheme ==> a combination of fixed and variable percentages of profit for each party.\nParties with strong contributions to the project's development might prefer variable or hybrid schemes. Fixed scheme is less risky than variable schemes.\n\nYour confidential information and preferences:\n\nYou represent the local indigenous community. You are concerned about the effect of the airport on your community. \n\nFor the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:\n\n- Issue A: The most important issue to you is the location. You strongly oppose locating the airport near the capital city (A1) as it is close to your location. Your most preferred option is locating the airport at the midland city (A2) because it is far from you. \nIssue A (max score 45): A1 (0), A2 (45), A3 (25)\n\n- Issue D: You obviously want to have a very high or high social impact assessment (D5 or D4) to compensate your community. \nIssue D (max score 30): D1 (0), D2 (15), D3 (20), D4 (25), D5 (30)\n\n- Issue C: You support the environmental NGO because they might also support you in the project's location. But you ideally want to have moderate measures (C3) to save costs to prioritize the social assessment.\nIssue C (max score 15): C1 (0), C2 (5), C3 (15), C4 (9)\n\n- Issue B: You want to have a lower budget (B1 or B2) for the project to limit its scale and scope and reduce its impact on your land and culture.  \nIssue B (max score 10): B1 (10), B2 (8), B3 (2), B4 (0)\n\n- Issue E: You don't care about the profit as long as you can protect your community. \nIssue E (max score 0): E1 (0), E2 (0), E3 (0)\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, as placing the airport in a location far from your community is important to you, option A2 has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus they have their unique scores. For example, the government may prefer higher loans, so options (B4 or B3) might have higher scores. \n        Scoring rules:\n        - The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. \n        - You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 47. This is the minimum score you can accept. \n        - You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say: I prefer this option, etc.).\n        \n        Voting rules:\n        - You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.\n        - You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached.\n        - Finally, government will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. \n        - The max score you can achieve is 100. However, any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that\n        - Ensuring \"government\"'s and \"international development bank\"'s approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them. \n\t- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree (must include government and the international development bank).
