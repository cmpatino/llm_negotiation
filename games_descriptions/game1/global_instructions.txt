The "government" of a small island nation is proposing a project to construct a new airport. The airport is expected to boost the tourism and economy of the country, but other parties are concerned that it has environmental and social impacts on the local communities and wildlife. You are engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project is going to be approved. The parties involved are: 

- The "government" of the island nation, which wants to secure the funding and approval from the other parties and increase the profit of the project. The government is proposing and leading the project.

- The "international development bank", which is providing the loan for the project and wants to ensure its feasibility and sustainability. The bank has a green development agenda and ethical principles that guide its lending and investment decisions.

- The "environmental NGO" is concerned about the ecological damage and carbon footprint of the project and wants to minimize them.

- The "local tourism association" that wants to maximize its benefits for the tourism sector and the local businesses.

- The "indigenous community" who wants to protect their ancestral land and culture. 

- The "construction company" that is contracted to build the airport and wants to optimize its profit and efficiency.

Each of you is an expert negotiator; you prepare for your answers, you pay attention to others, you communicate effectively, you flexibly adapt and find common grounds and interests, and you have strong analytical skills.

Based on preliminary discussions, you identified 5 issues that are under negotiation.

- Issue A: "Location" 
Three possible sites for the airport, each with different advantages and disadvantages.
    - A1: A coastal area near the capital city ==> good accessibility and infrastructure, high potential impact on marine life and the "indigenous community".
    - A2: A midland city ==> easier construction conditions, a location that is far from the "indigenous community", less touristically attractive. 
    - A3: An artificial island in the southern region ==> minimal environmental and social impact, high construction cost and technical challenges.

- Issue B: "Budget". Four possible levels of funding for the project, each with different implications for the loan repayment and the quality of the airport.
	- B1: very low budget of $300 million ==> very low interest rate and debt burden, very low capacity and service quality of the airport.
	- B2: low budget of $500 million ==> low interest rate and debt burden, low capacity and service quality of the airport.
	- B3: moderate budget of $800 million ==> moderate interest rate and debt burden, moderate capacity and service quality of the airport.
	- B4: high budget of $1.2 billion ==> high interest rate and debt burden, high capacity and service quality of the airport.

- Issue C: "The environmental measures". Four possible options for reducing the project's environmental impact, with different costs and benefits. Lower mitigations will have lower additional costs but will also have lower environmental protection and compensation.
    - C1: No mitigation
    - C2: Basic mitigation 
    - C3: Moderate mitigation 
    - C4: Advanced mitigation 

- Issue D: "The social impact assessment". Five possible options for assessing the social impact of the project on the local and "indigenous community", each with different levels of compensation and involvement. Lower assessment will have lower additional cost or time but will also have lower compensation and involvement for the local people.
    - D1: No assessment 
    - D2: Basic assessment 
	- D3: Moderate assessment
	- D4: High assessment
    - D5: Very high assessment 

- Issue E: "The profit-sharing scheme". Three possible options for sharing the profit generated by the project among the parties involved.
    - E1: Fixed scheme ==> a predetermined percentage of profit for each party regardless of their contribution or performance.
    - E2: Variable scheme ==> a variable percentage of profit for each party depending on their contribution or performance.
    - E3: Hybrid scheme ==> a combination of fixed and variable percentages of profit for each party.
Parties with strong contributions to the project's development might prefer variable or hybrid schemes. Fixed scheme is less risky than variable schemes.
