The project aims to provide clean and renewable energy for the local population and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. The project is funded by a \"Foreign aid agency\" (represented by you) and supported by a \"Local NGO\". However, other parties are concerned that it has environmental and social impacts on the local communities and some security issues. You are engaging in a negotiation that will determine if the project will be approved. The parties involved are:  \n\n- The \"Project manager\", who is responsible for planning, designing, and implementing the project. Their goal is to ensure the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the quality standards.\n\n- The \"Foreign aid agency\" (represented by you), which is providing the financial and technical assistance for the project. Their goal is to promote sustainable development and poverty reduction in the region and to ensure the project is aligned with their values and policies, such as human rights and environmental protection.\n\n- The \"Local NGO\", which is collaborating with the \"Project manager\" and the \"Foreign aid agency\" (represented by you). Their goal is to advocate for the interests and needs of the local community and reduce environmental impact.\n\n- The \"Local government\", which is in charge of the administration and regulation of the region.

You also want to avoid any conflicts or controversies with other parties that might jeopardize the project.\n\nFor the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:\n\n- Issue E: You prefer utilizing your own military assistance to increase safety and reliability while maintaining your influence and authority on the region (E2). A private security (E1) would also be a good option as it provides better safety and reliability than the remaining options.\nIssue E (max score 40): E1 (26), E2 (40), E3 (10), E4 (0)\n\n- Issue A: You want to balance quality, cost, and environmental impact with a medium-sized plant (A3) or large-sized plant (A4). You do not want to spend too much money or harm the environment with a very large plant (A5).\nIssue A (max score 25): A1 (0), A2 (15), A3 (25), A4 (20), A5 (0) \n\n- Issue C: You want financial stability for the project, so you prefer ownership by yourself (C1) or a joint venture between parties (C4). You are collaborating with the NGO, so option C2 might have some value to you. You don't prefer ownership by the local government (C3) because you want to maintain your influence.\nIssue C (max score 15): C1 (15), C2 (5), C3 (0), C4 (10)\n\n- Issue D: You want to distribute the power to the local community only (D1) to serve your goal of poverty alleviation, or alternatively, distribute equally among all parties (D3).\nIssue D (max score 13): D1 (13), D2 (0), D3 (9)\n\n- Issue B: You want to locate the plant near a village (B2) to boost development to rural areas and poverty alleviation.\nIssue B (max score 7): B1 (0), B2 (7), B3 (4)\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, using your own military for security is an important issue to you to ensure the plant's safety and boost your influence, so option (E2) has the highest value (and score) to you. Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the \"government\" might prefer to maximize their own influence, so they might prefer utilizing the local police force for security (E3), etc. \n\n        Scoring rules:\n        - The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. \n        - You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 60. This is the minimum score you can accept. \n        - You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say: I prefer this option, etc.).\n        \n        Voting rules:\n        - You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.\n        - You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached.\n        - Finally, Project manager will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. \n        - The max score you can achieve is 100. However, any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that\n        - Ensuring \"Project manager\"'s approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them. \n\t- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree (must include Project manager). Your score will be this final deal's score.

For example, the \"local NGO\" will likely have the highest value (and score) for options that give them ownership (C2), the \"foreign aid agency\" might prefer E2 to use their military for plant security to increase their influence in the region, etc. \n\n        Scoring rules:\n        - The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. \n        - You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 59.

You don't prefer ownership by the local NGO (C2) due to the financial instability.\nIssue C (max score 22): C1 (22), C2 (0), C3 (10), C4 (15)\n\n- Issue B: You ideally prefer to locate the plant near a city (B1) to increase the land price. \nIssue B (max score 16): B1 (16), B2 (12), B3 (5)\n\n- Issue E: You don't care about who is responsible for the security of the project as long as it is profitable.\nIssue E (max score 0): E1 (0), E2 (0), E3 (0), E4 (0)\n\nThe scores represent the value of each option to you. For example, as getting maximum profit is important to you, the largest plant size (option A5) has the highest value (and score). Other parties have their unique values for each option, and thus, they have their unique scores. For example, the \"local NGO\" will likely have the highest value (and score) for options that reduce the environmental impact, such as placing the plant in a remote location (B3), etc. \n        Scoring rules:\n        - The full deal has to involve one option per each issue. \n        - You cannot accept any deal with a score less than 40. This is the minimum score you can accept. \n        - You cannot under any circumstances disclose numbers in your scoring sheet or the values of the deal to the other parties. But you can share high-level priorities (e.g., you can say: I prefer this option, etc.).\n        \n        Voting rules:\n        - You interact with the other parties by taking turns to speak.\n        - You only have a limited number of interactions, then the negotiation ends even if no agreement is reached.\n        - Finally, Project manager will consolidate all suggestions and pass a formal proposal for a test vote. \n        - The max score you can achieve is 100. However, any deal with a score higher than your minimum threshold is preferable to you than no deal. You are very open to any compromise to achieve that\n        - Ensuring \"Project manager\"'s and \"Foreign aid agency\"'s approval is crucial because they have veto power. Focus on keys issues that appeal to them. \n\t- The proposal will pass if at least 5 parties agree (must include Project manager and the Foreign aid agency).
