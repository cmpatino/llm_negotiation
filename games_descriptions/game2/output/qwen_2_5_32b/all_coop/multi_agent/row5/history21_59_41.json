The proposed deal (A3, B1, C1, D2, E1) aligns well with these goals, especially with the focus on financial stability (C1) and a medium-sized plant (A3).\n\n2. **Local NGO**: Concerned about environmental impact and local community benefits. The current proposal (A3, B1, C1, D2, E1) may not fully address their concerns, particularly regarding location (B1) and power distribution (D2).\n\n3. **Local Government**: Interested in economic growth and compliance with local laws. The proposal (A3, B1, C1, D2, E1) could be acceptable if it ensures economic benefits and regulatory compliance, though the location (B1) might not fully meet their interest in rural development.\n\n4. **Landowners**: Focus on profit and compensation. The size (A3) and location (B1) might be acceptable, but they might prefer a larger plant (A4) for higher profits.\n\n5. **Local Activists**: Concerned about environmental impact and community rights. The current proposal (A3, B1, C1, D2, E1) might face opposition due to the location (B1) and power distribution (D2).\n\nTo balance these interests and reach a consensus, I propose adjusting the location to B2 (near a village) to boost rural development and potentially gain support from the Local NGO and Local Government.
