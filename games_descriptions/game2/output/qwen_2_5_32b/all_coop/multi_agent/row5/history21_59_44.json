However, this proposal does not fully address my concerns regarding environmental impact and community empowerment.\n\nTo find a middle ground, I need to consider the preferences of other parties while advocating for my key issues.

Security measures should involve the local community to reduce resistance and provide employment.\n\nMy proposed deal is <DEAL>A2,B2,C4,D1,E4</DEAL>.
